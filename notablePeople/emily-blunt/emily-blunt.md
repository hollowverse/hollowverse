Emily Blunt was born and raised in London, England.

All we have to go on with Blunt's religion is unsourced speculation, but at least they all seem to agree. If we are to believe the rumors, she is Anglican Episcopalian, or presumably, a member of the Church of England.<a class="source-citation" href="http://lists.lucywho.com/anglican-episcopalian-celebrities-c19254541.html" title="List of Anglican / Episcopalian celebrities.">[1]</a>

But considering I found no information to back up this claim, I'm going to stick with non-religious until you commenters can point me in the right direction.

Her politics are equally as mysterious. Her uncle is a Conservative currently serving in Parliament,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.stutteringhelp.org/famous-people/emily-blunt" title="Emily Blunt.">[2]</a> but there's no indication that she's following in his political footsteps.

She tells a story of meeting Obama and being a little intimidated when he complimented her on her work as an actress, so she started laughed hysterically. She said,

>I don't know what happened, I've never fallen to pieces like that in front of anyone. . . . And Michelle [Obama] gave me a hug, I think out of pity, because I was such a mess!<a class="source-citation" href="http://newsbusters.org/blogs/tim-graham/2012/03/19/time-actress-has-crush-president-obama" title="Time: Actress &apos;Has a Crush on President Obama.&apos;">[3]</a>

That might mean she's smitten with the president, but it really doesn't say anything about her political affiliation. So, as with religion, I'm going to call her non-political until further notice.
