Amy Macdonald was born and raised just outside Glasgow, Scotland.

Macdonald does not appear to be even remotely religious. There's nothing on her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/Amy__Macdonald) besides the occasional tweet like this one when she had a sore throat on tour:

>Thank god for honey and lemon!!<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FAmy__Macdonald%2Fstatus%2F304351375498805248" title="Amy_Macdonald: Thank you Zurich! Perfect crowd! …">[1]</a>

Do you think it means anything that she didn't capitalize god? Probably not. Her lyrics don't have much to indicate religion either, except a quick, "God rest your soul," in her song "My Only One."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azlyrics.com%2Flyrics%2Famymacdonald%2Fmyonlyone.html" title="Amy Macdonald Lyrics.">[2]</a>

She probably grew up in a generally Christian community, and considering her Scottish roots, she probably has some Presbyterian blood, or maybe even Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReligion_in_Scotland" title="Religion in Scotland.">[3]</a> But it's fair to say that Macdonald is most likely non-religious herself.


## Politics in a Beautiful Light

Macdonald makes a point of not engaging in the political debate. When asked her opinion on the Scottish independence question, she said she didn't care to give it,

>I've never been one of those people who force my beliefs on other people so I'll just keep that to myself.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglaswegian.co.uk%2Fglasgow-news%2Fnews%2F2012%2F10%2F31%2Famy-macdonald-time-for-bickering-over-scottish-independence-to-end-102692-23936974%2F" title="Amy Macdonald: Time for bickering over Scottish independence to end.">[4]</a>

She did, however, express her hope that the issue could be debated and discussed in a productive and civil manner. She said,

>It'll be better when we can actually have a proper debate but I'm not sure if that'll ever happen. Politicians don't do that very often, but I would hope that it'll be positive rather than the mess we've got just now. . . . I just want it to get into an actual positive debate about the pros and cons instead of the constant bickering and mudslinging.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglaswegian.co.uk%2Fglasgow-news%2Fnews%2F2012%2F10%2F31%2Famy-macdonald-time-for-bickering-over-scottish-independence-to-end-102692-23936974%2F" title="Amy Macdonald: Time for bickering over Scottish independence to end.">[5]</a>

That's a lesson politicians could use on just about every issue, don't you think? If Macdonald comes out with any other interesting political statements, please keep us updated in the comments.
