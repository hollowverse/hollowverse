J. K. Rowling grew up near Bristol, England in an Anglican family. However, she converted to the Church of Scotland later in life.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3668658/J-K-Rowling-Christianity-inspired-Harry-Potter.html" title="J.K. Rowling: &apos;Christianity Inspired Harry Potter">[1]</a>

Harry Potter has been the subject of much criticism from devout Christians, who often object to its themes in the occult, magic, and witchcraft.

But it wasn't until the seventh and last book of The Harry Potter Series had come out that Rowling opened up about her religious beliefs and admitted that her books were heavily inspired by Christian themes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/fictionreviews/3668658/J-K-Rowling-Christianity-inspired-Harry-Potter.html" title="J.K. Rowling: &apos;Christianity Inspired Harry Potter">[2]</a>

Rowling seems devout, but uncertain. She has mentioned that her opinions of things like an afterlife, the soul, and morality might change on any given day, but that all tolled, she generally follows Christianity. When asked if she believes in God, she said:

>I do struggle with it; I couldn't pretend that I'm not doubt-ridden about a lot of things and that would be one of them but I would say yes. <a class="source-citation" href="#http://joansgray.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/one-of-us/" title="One of Us">[3]</a>

Yet, she questions herself, saying:

> I feel very drawn to religion, but at the same time I feel a lot of uncertainty. I live in a state of spiritual flux. I believe in the permanence of the soul.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://joansgray.wordpress.com/2011/08/03/one-of-us/" title="One of Us">[4]</a>

The real question is: Does she believe in magic?


## I'm voting for the wizard party

Rowling hasn't been shy to talk about her political views, which lean quite heavily towards the liberal/Labour/Democrat side of the fence.

During the most recent Parlaimentary elections, Rowling donated £1 million to the Labour party.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://dissentingdemocrat.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-politics-of-j-k-rowling/" title="The Politics of J.K. Rowling">[5]</a>

She has been openly critical of Britain's more conservative Tory party and their Prime Minister, David Cameron, particularly for his policies directed at women and families, which seem to favor married couples over single moms. Rowling spent her days of early motherhood in poverty, so this issue hits close to home. Responding to a Camoron proposal to give £150 to poor married couples, Rowling said:

>If Mr Cameron's only practical advice to women living in poverty, the sole carers of their children, is 'get married, and we'll give you £150,' he reveals himself to be completely ignorant of their true situation.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://dissentingdemocrat.wordpress.com/2011/04/28/the-politics-of-j-k-rowling/" title="The Politics of J.K. Rowling">[6]</a>

Rowling has even offered her opinion on U.S. politics, sticking to her more liberal/Democrat tendencies. During the 2008 presidential race, Rowling said:

>I want a Democrat in the White House. And it seems a pity that Clinton and Obama are rivals because both are extraordinary.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://elpais.com/diario/2008/02/08/cultura/1202425201_850215.html" title="&quot;Ser invisible… eso sería lo más.&quot;">[7]</a>

Hillary? Obama? Doesn't matter, as long as they're blue.
