Lynn Collins was born in Houston, Texas. She grew up there and in Singapore and Japan.

Collins was raised a strict Southern Baptist. But it would seem that exposure to the culture of New York City drastically changed her perspective. She said:

>My family are very, very religious in Texas. They're Southern Baptists. I left to go to New York when I was 17 and I realised I wasn't Southern Baptist. That's not how I am inclined.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/down-to-earth-with-the-most-beautiful-woman-in-the-universe-26834023.html" title="Down to earth with the most beautiful woman in the universe">[1]</a>

This began a journey of spiritual discovery for Collins in which she discovered a holistic, unified approach to religion:

>I started studying all different religions and all different beliefs — mysticism, paganism, everything. I got to a place a few years ago where I realised that, to me, they're all the same thing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.independent.ie/woman/celeb-news/down-to-earth-with-the-most-beautiful-woman-in-the-universe-26834023.html" title="Down to earth with the most beautiful woman in the universe">[2]</a>

Her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/lynncollins7) confirms this pan-religious view, with tweets and retweets about everything from conventional Christianity to Dalai Lama quotes to healing crystals to palmistry. She is indeed a meta-religious person, and most likely very spiritual.


## Left-leaning diversity

Collins' politics seem constrained entirely within her Twitter feed. But what a gold mine! She appears to be more on the Democrat/liberal side of things. She signaled her support of both Obama and gun control when she retweeted this Obama message:

>FACT: Since 1968, more Americans have died from gun violence than in all of America's wars—combined. #DemandAction<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/lynncollins7" title="lynn collins (lynncollins7) on Twitter. Twitter">[3]</a>

She's tweeted about animal rights, environmentalism and fracking, and gay rights when she tweeted a Human Rights Campaign message:

>"Love knows no religion. Love knows no color. Love knows no gender." Wade Henderson #UnitedForMarriage<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/lynncollins7" title="lynn collins (lynncollins7) on Twitter. Twitter">[4]</a>

Plus, she backhandedly criticized the Catholic Church and expressed her affinity to feminism when she retweeted a satirical message from the editor of the Daily Beast during deliberations for a new Pope:

>Unchanged stance on gays, contraception & women? We gotta have a nun as next pope. No change til pink smoke billows @ #Vatican #PopeFrancis<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/lynncollins7" title="lynn collins (lynncollins7) on Twitter. Twitter">[5]</a>

Clearly, she's quite liberal.
