      I happen to think he is the most impressive one of the four [candidates]

      I respect all of them because I wouldn't do it and they are all on my team but he is the most impressive as an individual.

    context: In an interview with The Guardian
    content: |
      I'm not a practising Catholic or I wouldn't be living unwed with a woman, and I don't think all poofs are going to hell, and I don't think everyone who's had an abortion is damned, most of my friends are atheists and I understand atheism, I get it, but I happen to be a theist. I believe in our answerableness to something else. You're not the only cunt in the world.
