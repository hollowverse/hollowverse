Lee Min-ho was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea.

Most things Lee-related happen in Korean, not English, so I'm at a little bit of a disadvantage. But, according to an interview posted on one of his fan sites, when asked what his religion is, he said,

>I don't have one for myself, but my parents are Buddhist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.leeminhoworld.com/leeminho" title="Lee Min Ho.">[1]</a>

That seems entirely possibly considering a little under half of South Koreans don't adhere to any particular religion, and a little less than a quarter consider themselves Buddhist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Korea" title="Religion in South Korea.">[2]</a>

I guess he didn't have much else to say–at least that's been translated–because I couldn't find anything else but speculation. Let's move on, shall we?

Lee doesn't seem to be too interested in politics. I thought he might have an opinion about South Korea's volatile neighbor to the north, but I couldn't find a thing. He did have a role in one movie playing a spy who gathered intelligence against North Korea,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.korea.com/blog/enter/tv/city-hunter%E2%80%99s-lee-min-ho-wins-high-praise-for-his-spectacular-action-scenes-and-absorbing-acting-skill/" title="City Hunter&apos;s Lee Min Ho wins high praise for his spectacular action scene and absorbing acting skill.">[3]</a> so I guess we can assume he's not a North Korean sympathizer.

He didn't have anything to say about South Korea's first woman president, Park Geun-hye, who was elected at the tail end of 2012. I couldn't even find a spotting of him at the voting booth.

So, my best guess is that Lee is entirely non-political. Do you speak Korean and have any insight for us? If so, please let us know in the comment.
