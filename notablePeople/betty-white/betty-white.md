Betty White was born in Oak Park, Illinois and grew up in Los Angeles, California.

White is a member of the Unity Church according to numerous sources,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.californiality.com%2F2012%2F01%2Fbetty-white-at-90.html" title="Betty White at 90!">[1]</a> though I can't find anything with her actually talking about it. Nevertheless, it's an interesting and very liberal branch of Christianity that doesn't take the Bible literally<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thirdage.com%2Fcelebrities%2Fa-salute-to-betty-white" title="A Salute To Betty White">[2]</a> and takes a more pantheistic view of God,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marketfaith.org%2Fnon-christian-worldviews%2Fthe-gospel-according-to-famous-amos-unity-school-of-christianity%2F" title="The Gospel According to Famour Amos: Unity School of Christianity">[3]</a> but keeps it's theology rather open so members can still feel welcome even with a wide range of beliefs. The Unity Church promotes a positive, affirmative view of Christianity and encourages personal relationships over hierarchical social structures.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fchatterbusy.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F10%2Fis-betty-white-jewish.html" title="Is Betty White Jewish?">[4]</a> It's like all the happy things about Christianity without all the guilt and dogma.

White is also what's called an "Ethical Vegan,"<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpw%2FBetty_White.html" title="The religion of Betty White, actress">[5]</a> a type of vegan with a "religious/philosophical component."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpw%2FBetty_White.html" title="The religion of Betty White, actress">[6]</a>

But for the most part, White isn't keen on discussing religion.


## Once a Democrat…

First of all, did you know Betty White was the mayor of Los Angeles? Alright, it was an honorary award, but I had you there.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thirdage.com%2Fcelebrities%2Fa-salute-to-betty-white" title="A Salute To Betty White">[7]</a>

White is a serious Democrat from the old school. Her endorsements include Franklin Delano Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, John F. Kennedy, Jimmy Carter, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0924508%2Fbio" title="Betty White (I) – Biography">[8]</a> As Obama was gearing up for re-election in 2012, White said:

>I very, very much favor Barack Obama in the election. I like what Obama has done and how he represents us.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F05%2F12%2Fbetty-white-obama-endorsement_n_1511526.html" title="Betty White, Obama: Actress Says She &quot;Very, Very Much Favors&quot; The Incumbent">[9]</a>

Plus, her lifetime campaign contribution total of $15,500 has gone exclusively to Democrats and Democrat political organizations.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Fcelebrity_political_donations%2FBetty_White.php" title="Betty White&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[10]</a>

But it doesn't stop there. White, who is pushing 100 years old, is considered a liberal today. What do you think they called her in, like, the 40s? She supports gay marriage, for one, saying:

>I don't care who anybody sleeps with. If a couple has been together all that time–and there are gay relationships that are more solid than some heterosexual ones–I think it's fine if they want to get married. I don't know how people can get so anti-something… Mind your own business, take care of your affairs, and don't worry about other people so much.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Ffront.moveon.org%2Fbetty-white-cute-kitten-ears-and-the-best-quote-you-can-share-today%2F" title="Betty White, Cute Kitten Ears, And The Best Quote You Can Share Today.">[11]</a>

Plus, her animal rights activism borders on obsession (refer to the "Ethical Veganism" mentioned above). Her animal organization support extends–to name a few–to the Los Angeles Zoo Commission, the Morris Animal Foundation, and Actors & Others for Animals.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0924508%2Fbio" title="Betty White (I) – Biography">[12]</a>

She's a passionate old lady, for sure.
