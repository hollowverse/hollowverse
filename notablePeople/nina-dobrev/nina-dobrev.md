Nina Dobrev was born in Sofia, Bulgaria and grew up in Ontario, Canada.

Dobrev hasn't spoken about her religion other than tweeting about celebrating her "Name Day." This is a Bulgarian, Eastern Orthodox (Russian or Greek Orthodox) holiday where people of a certain name are celebrated if they share their name with an Orthodox saint. Dobrev said:

>In Bulgaria we have a tradition/celebration called a 'Name Day.' Each person has one – today is mine! Happy Name day to everyone else like me!<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.cambio.com/2010/12/06/nina-dobrev-celebrates-her-bulgarian-name-day/" title="Nina Dobrev Celebrates Her Bulgarian Name Day on Cambio">[1]</a>

Plus, at least one source lists Dobrev among Russian Orthodox celebrities.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.whosdatedwho.com/sections/celebrities/religion/russian-orthodox_n" title="Celebrity Religion – Russian Orthodox (Celebrities)">[2]</a>

## Politics

Dobrev was happy about president Obama's endorsement of same-sex marriage, saying it shouldn't be controversial because we're "living in the 21st Century."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtzqN_Gqe3U" title="Nina Dobrev Reacts to President Obama&apos;s Gay Marriage Stance">[3]</a> She's a liberal, but because she's still Canadian, I couldn't go so far to say that she's a Democrat.
