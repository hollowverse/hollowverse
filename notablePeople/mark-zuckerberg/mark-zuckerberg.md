Mark Zuckerberg grew up in White Plains, New York in a Jewish family.

But he's not so into it and, not surprisingly, according to a Facebook update, Zuckerberg considers himself an atheist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB119621309736406034.html" title="Too Much Information">[1]</a>

Here's what I think: Zuckerberg has over a billion dollars and he's so young, the Cold War was over by the time he was 5 years old. If anything, he's living the high life, subscribing to Hedonism<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonism" title="Hedonism">[2]</a> and he couldn't give two shits about religion and politics. He's actually only voted once, in 2008, in the national electionâ€”and he didn't declare a political party.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.baycitizen.org/technology/story/zuckerberg-voting-record/" title="Mark Zuckerberg Doesn&apos;t &apos;Like&apos; Voting">[3]</a>

Still, he's a powerful and influential businessman with a direct connection to over 500 million people (or voters depending on how you look at it) via Facebook and he can't help but be dragged into the political arena.


## It's all puppy dogs and rainbows to me

Priming himself as the "people's president" for the 2012 election, Obama cornered Zuckerberg at a town hall-style meeting trying to sell the idea of raising taxes on rich people. All Zuckerberg said was:

>I'm cool with it.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-21/news/29476756_1_facebook-s-mark-zuckerberg-facebook-headquarters-gop-plan" title="President Obama and Mark Zuckerberg buddy up at Facebook headquarters in Silicon Valley">[4]</a>

Let's just not expect too much from Marky.

Facebook does have its own political action committee, designed to lobby politicians regarding issues of media, privacy, patents, and the technology industry in general. They have yet to endorse any single candidate but have come out strongly against internet censorship bills. Zuckerberg said:

>The internet is the most powerful tool we have for creating a more open and connected world. We can't let poorly thought-out laws get in the way of the internet's development.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/facebook/facebook-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-talks-sopa-pipa/7600" title="Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg talks SOPA, PIPA">[5]</a>
