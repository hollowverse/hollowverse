B.o.B., also known as Bobby Ray, or Bobby Ray Simmons Jr., was born in Winston-Salem, North Carolina and raised in Decatur, Georgia, a suburb of Atlanta.

Bobby Ray's father is a Reverend at what appears to be a non-denominational Christian church, so we can be sure the rapper went to church growing up.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/parents-of-grammy-nominee-speak" title="PARENTS OF GRAMMY NOMINEE SPEAK.">[1]</a> Now, he doesn't talk about religion much in public.

In his song "Left Field," he distances himself from any religious affiliation:

>And I ain't really catholic but/ Daily I confess/ I ain't a Christian rapper or a civil activist<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.urbanlyrics.com/lyrics/bob/leftfield.html" title="&quot;Left Field&quot; lyrics by B.O.B [a.k.a. BOBBY RAY].">[2]</a>

And considering that in his songs he also swears to<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/bob/whereareyoubobvsbobbyray.html" title="B.O.B. LYRICS – Where Are You.">[3]</a> and damns God,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.urbanlyrics.com/lyrics/bob/fuckyou.html" title="&quot;Fuck You&quot; lyrics by B.O.B [a.k.a. BOBBY RAY].">[4]</a> he probably isn't terribly devout anymore, if he ever was.


## Young Black Democrat

Bobby Ray aligns with the Democrats–black Democrats anyway. He performed at the Democratic National Committee's Gen44 Summit concert in 2010. He got to meet the president, and found out Obama's got him on his iPod, which he seemed pretty stoked about. He said about the event,

>On a scale of one to ten I would probably have to [rate it] at 44.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.rapbasement.com/bobby-ray/100110-rapper-bob-performs-for-president-barack-obama.html" title="BOB Performs for President Barack Obama.">[5]</a>

He also recorded a short video endorsement for Democrat Johnny Dupree during his failed campaign for governor of Mississippi in 2011.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lOswy4NqOzg" title="B.O.B. aka Bobby Ray says &quot;Vote for Johnny DuPree&quot; Nov. 8.">[6]</a>

He joined the organization Hip Hop Caucus, which encourages young people to be part of the democratic process, in encouraging people to vote in 2010.<a class="source-citation" href="http://rapfix.mtv.com/2010/11/02/obama-bob-encourage-vote/" title="President Obama And B.o.B Encourage Youth To Vote.">[7]</a> So even though he doesn't talk about specific issues, he's clearly involved in the political process.
