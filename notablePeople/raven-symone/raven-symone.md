Raven-Symoné Christina Pearman, mostly known as Raven-Symoné or just Raven, was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in Ossining, New York.

Raven doesn't like to talk about her particular brand of spirituality very much. She's says it's too personal to put out there for the public to dissect.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.pittsburghurbanmedia.com/Shes-So-Raven-Raven-Symone--The-Tinker-Bell-and-the-Great-Fairy-Rescue-Interview-with-Kam-Williams/" title="She&apos;s So Raven! Raven-Symone&apos;- The &quot;Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue&quot; Interview with Kam Williams.">[1]</a> But, sorry Raven, we're going to do our best to dissect it anyway.

In spite of her desire to keep her spirituality private, she did mention that she's a "new wave thinker," that she "respects religions,"<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.pittsburghurbanmedia.com/Shes-So-Raven-Raven-Symone--The-Tinker-Bell-and-the-Great-Fairy-Rescue-Interview-with-Kam-Williams/" title="She&apos;s So Raven! Raven-Symone&apos;- The &quot;Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue&quot; Interview with Kam Williams.">[2]</a> and,

>I'm a very spiritual person, and I believe that there are amazing special gifts that people are blessed with. It just depends on whether you want to listen or not.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://iluluonline.com/raven-symone-on-spirituality-im-a-new-wave-thinker/" title="Raven-Symone On Spirituality: &quot;I&apos;m A New Wave Thinker.&quot;">[3]</a>

I'm assuming by "new wave" she means New Age. And her Twitter feed seems to back that up. She frequently tweets and retweets little New Age messages of hope like this:

>Within the light is an intelligence for the evolution of your DNA toward higher & better form!!!<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/MissRavenSymone" title="Raven-Symone` (MissRavenSymone) on Twitter.">[4]</a>

And this one:

>finding energy that compliments mine. Earth sea and sky filled dreams!<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/MissRavenSymone/status/287384219364237312" title="MissRavenSymone: finding energy that compliments …">[5]</a>

So if you want to know more about Raven's spirituality, I'd suggest following her on Twitter. If anything juicy pops up, let us know in the comments!


## Raven for Women!

The fact that Raven is into new age spirituality makes me think she's probably not conservative. But she hasn't given us much to back up that assumption, unless her interest in women's health care is an indication.

She's involved in a campaign to help women plan their lives in regards to education, careers, and family planning–including contraception.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/27/raven-symone-plan-it-forward-global-initiative_n_1460177.html#s825713&title=RavenSymone_Photos" title="Raven Symone, &apos;Sister Act&apos; Actress, Aims To Inspire Young Women Through &apos;Plan It Forward&apos; Global Initiative.">[6]</a> So she's not into abstinence-only family planning. That could be a liberal position.

She didn't have anything to say on her Twitter feed about Obama, but the fact that she's a black woman in the U.S. makes it pretty likely that she supported the president.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.gallup.com/poll/154559/us-presidential-election-center.aspx" title="U.S. Presidential Election Center.">[7]</a>

In terms of non-partisan politics, she's had a say in the body-image discussion which pops up for a number of women under the scrutiny of the public gaze. After she lost 35 pounds, the press took notice, and it annoyed the young actress. She said,

>Actually, now I wear bigger clothes because I don't like the way people stare at me. I liked it before. Now, you're just looking at me for the wrong reasons. Before, you were actually looking at me for a real reason.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/06/ravensymone-shows-off-dra_n_805280.html" title="Raven-Symone Shows Off Dramatic Weight Loss, Talks Body.">[8]</a>

That's not a sentiment you hear too much from Hollywood. She projects the image of a strong, self-confident woman, who seems like a good alternative to the typical famous role model.
