Martin Lawrence was born on an American military base in Frankfurt, Germany. He grew up mostly in several towns in the state of Maryland.

Lawrence is religious, but I had a really hard time finding any clue as to the specifics. He is very likely Christian, because most Americans are and if he wasn't, people would probably be talking about it. As for a specific denomination, it's anyone's guess, but some kind of Protestant seems likely.

All right, onto what we do know. Lawrence is fond of thanking God and calling himself God-blessed and God-inspired in interviews.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ropeofsilicon.com%2Finterview_martin_lawrence_talks_rebound%2F" title="Interview: Martin Lawrence Talks &apos;Rebound.&apos;">[1]</a> He is particularly thankful to the Almighty for helping him get back on his feet after some anger issues and legal troubles. He said,

>I'm most proud of the blessings that God has bestowed upon me, in my life. He's given me the vision to truly see that you can fall down, but you can still get back up. Hopefully I'll learn from my mistakes and have the opportunity to strengthen and improve the next thing I do.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brainyquote.com%2Fquotes%2Fauthors%2Fm%2Fmartin_lawrence.html" title="Martin Lawrence Quotes.">[2]</a>

## Obama's House

Lawrence is mostly non-political, except for his support for Barack Obama. He didn't make any big campaign contributions or stump for him on the campaign trail, but he lets it be known that he's stoked to have a black man in the White House.

He put a little Obama segment in the stand-up routine he toured with in 2011. He said,

>I want to take the time to say how proud I am we got a black president, y'all. Boy that shit's cool, ain't it? He's a bad motherfucker too, he just caught Bin Laden and shit.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dke5FJdop8yM" title="Martin Lawrence (We Got a Black President Yall).">[3]</a>

But of course, he had to make fun of the man too. He said you can see the white boy in him come out when he dances.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dke5FJdop8yM" title="Martin Lawrence (We Got a Black President Yall).">[4]</a>

So I think it's safe to assume he votes for the Democrats, but it's not clear that he cares much about the most pressing issues of today's left-wing party: gun control, gay marriage, women's reproductive rights, or anything else. Maybe he figures as long as we've got Obama in there, he doesn't have much to worry about.
