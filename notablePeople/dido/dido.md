Dido, whose birth name is Florian Cloud de Bounevialle Armstrong, was born and raised in London, England.

The singer appears to be totally non-religious. I could find no mention about her faith or lack thereof in interviews. And even when she makes potentially religious references in songs, they're not really about religion.

In her song "I'm No Angel," angel is used in a purely metaphorical and non-religious way. She doesn't mention heaven or God–just a person who's less than perfect.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/dido/imnoangel.html" title="DIDO LYRICS – I&apos;m No Angel.">[1]</a> And her song "Us 2 Little Gods," which appears to be autobiographical, is about her and her husband creating their own world–not God creating it for them.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.elyricsworld.com/us_2_little_gods_lyrics_dido.html" title="Dido – Us 2 Little Gods Lyrics.">[2]</a> Religious references in her songs serve to illustrate her lack of religion, not the other way around.

And finally, the song she wrote about her father's death, "Grafton Street," has absolutely no reference to any higher power at all. No heaven, no praying, no angels, no God. Nothing.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/grafton-street-lyrics-dido.html" title="DIDO – GRAFTON STREET LYRICS.">[3]</a> Considering death tends to bring out religion even in the non-religious, I'd say she's solidly in the latter category.


## Vaguely Liberal

Dido's politics are no less ambiguous. She wrote one song about abortion that takes a sympathetic view, even if not outright saying it's okay:

>And who he would become, all the things he'd have done/ Would he have loved you, and not let you down/ And would he be stronger than his father/ Don't punish yourself, leave it well alone<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/310/" title="Isobel Lyric Meaning.">[4]</a>

She said about the song that she was not trying to state an opinion on abortion.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_songs_about_abortion" title="List of songs about abortion.">[5]</a> But an ambiguous position on abortion is almost a statement in itself. After all, she probably wouldn't have written a song like that if she was strongly and emotionally opposed to abortion.

Along similar lines, Dido could be into women's rights, since she labels herself as an independent woman:

>I like being a strong, independent woman, and to be honest, I was never afraid to be on my own.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/d/dido_armstrong.html" title="Dido Armstrong Quotes.">[6]</a>

And finally (I know it's weak), she may be a supporter of gay rights since she seems to think not being homophobic is a good trait to have. Defending Eminem, who heavily sampled one of her songs on his controversial song "Stan," and with whom she worked on the song's video, Dido said the rapper is definitely not "misogynist or homophobic."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2001/jan/29/artsfeatures" title="Interview: Dido.">[7]</a>

All right, I know I'm stretching. If I had to put her into a category, it would be non-political/liberal. If you know anything more about Dido, please let us know in the comments.
