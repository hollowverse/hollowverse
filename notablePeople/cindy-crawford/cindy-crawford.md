Cindy Crawford was born and raised in DeKalb, Illinois.

Crawford is a Protestant, but in some articles and interviews earlier in life, she didn't seem very dedicated to the church. One article described her as a "nonpracticing Protestant."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20106493,00.html" title="True Romance – Models, Sexiest Man Alive, Super-Couples, Cindy Crawford, Richard Gere.">[1]</a> And in another article she described her views as unconventional:

>I'm religious but in my own personal way. I always say that I have a Cindy Crawford religion – it's my own.<a class="source-citation" href="http://religionandmore.wordpress.com/2010/11/30/cindy-crawford-on-religion-why-the-hell-not/" title="Cindy Crawford on Religion? Why the hell not…">[2]</a>

But after she had her first child, the Cindy Crawford religion sounded a little more like Presbyterian. She told one magazine that she would raise her children Protestant while still exposing them to Judaism, her husband's religion.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20128757,00.html" title="Cindy&apos;s Joy – Birth, Birth Announcements, Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber.">[3]</a> And in 2007 she hosted a fundraiser event for the Malibu Presbyterian Church which was described as her "home church."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.tvguide.com/news/cindy-crawford-jennifer-12042.aspx" title="Cindy Crawford: Jennifer Love&apos;s Bikini Backlash Was &quot;So Mean.&quot;">[4]</a>

So it seems like she's fairly religious now, even if she wasn't in the past.


## An Evolving Independent Mind… or a Flip Flopper

The label we're able to put on Crawford's political views is Independent. For instance, she supported Barack Obama in 2008 and even donated a few thousand bucks to his campaign, but then appeared in a fundraising video for Mitt Romney during his bid for the Republican presidential nomination in 2011.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.opensecrets.org/news/2011/05/ceo-5-18-2011.html" title="Cindy Crawford&apos;s Split Political Loyalties.">[5]</a>

As a model, it seems she is automatically the focus of scrutiny by some feminists, and she's received her share of criticism. But she doesn't shy away from a response:

>When I did 'Playboy,' I got letters from women who didn't consider it feminist to do nude photographs. I thought the whole POINT of being a feminist was that you got to make your own choices.<a class="source-citation" href="http://quotes.lucywho.com/cindy-crawford-quotes-t544.html" title="Cindy Crawford Quotes.">[6]</a>

She appeared in a PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) anti-fur campaign and signed a statement with them that she would refuse to wear fur. And then she did, a few times, on the covers of magazines. That change of heart prompted PETA to call her a "morally bankrupt washed-up former model."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2007/10/26/cindy-crawford-desperate-and-pathetic.aspx" title="Cindy Crawford: Desperate and Pathetic.">[7]</a>

She hasn't said anything that I could find about gay marriage, but she's apparently a supporter of PFLAG (Parents and Friends of Lesbians and Gays).<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000340/bio" title="Cindy Crawford (I) – Biography.">[8]</a> And she tries to do her part to be eco-friendly by cutting down on the number of plastic bags she uses and eliminating plastic water bottles from her home.<a class="source-citation" href="http://watch.accesshollywood.com/award-shows/award-shows/hollywood-green:-cindy-crawford-gets-eco-friendly/1309745853001" title="Hollywood Green: Cindy Crawford Gets Eco-Friendly.">[9]</a>

It appears that Crawford is going to blaze her own path through politics, and isn't going to do what people expect. It's like her religion: she's got her own Cindy Crawford brand of politics to which she adheres.
