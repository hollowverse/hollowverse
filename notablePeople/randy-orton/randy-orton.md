Randy Orton was born and raised in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Orton is a Christian, but what denomination remains a topic of much speculation among fans, with most people leaning towards Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_randy_orton_catholic" title="Is randy orton catholic?.">[1]</a> One fan even thought he would make a pretty good pope.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.1up.com/do/blogEntry?bId=4472829" title="Randy Orton for Pope.">[2]</a> But no word from Randy himself.

He's at least Christian enough to get a bible passage tattooed on his arm:

>Be sober be vigilant, your adversary the devil as a lion is waiting to devour you.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.noelboyd.com/2009/04/wwe-superstar-randy-orton.html" title="WWE Superstar Randy Orton.">[3]</a>

That's kind of intense, but appropriate for a professional wrestler.

His theme song–which was written specifically for him<a class="source-citation" href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/224933-the-meaning-behind-randy-ortons-theme-music" title="The Meaning Behind Randy Orton&apos;s Theme Music.">[4]</a> –includes some references to Christianity, although in a negative and questioning way:

>You got your rules and your religion/ all designed to keep you safe/ but when rules start getting broken/ you start questioning your faith.<a class="source-citation" href="http://lyrics.wikia.com/Rev_Theory:Voices_(Randy_Orton_Theme_Song)" title="Rev Theory: Voices (Randy Orton Theme Song) Lyrics.">[5]</a>

But I think in this case permanently tattooing bible excerpts on his body trumps the music that plays when he's entering the ring. Let me know if you think I'm wrong.

About politics, we have no signs at all–no tattoos, no songs. Not even any rumors. Randy Orton has exactly nothing to say about the political world as far as I can tell. He hasn't endorsed a party or candidate, or spoken about any key political issues.

Do you have any insight into Orton's politics? Let me know in the comments.
