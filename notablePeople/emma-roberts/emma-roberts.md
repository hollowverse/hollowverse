Emma Roberts was born in Rhinebeck, New York. She grew up there and in Los Angeles, California.

There is exactly no information about Roberts' religious beliefs. One uncited commentor claims that the actress said in an interview that she doesn't like to discuss religion in public.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FIs_Emma_Roberts_a_Christian" title="Is Emma Roberts a Christian.">[1]</a> That could mean that she's a member of satanist cult that's using her star-power to infiltrate the masses, but I think we'd better assume for now that she's non-religious.

We don't have much to go on with her politics, either, but at least enough to know she's probably liberal. The one cause she has openly supported is gay marriage, like so many other celebrities. She apparently tweeted an "Amen" in response to Barack Obama's declaration of support for gay marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywire.com%2F2012%2F05%2Fhollywood-reacts-president-obamas-same-sex-marriage-stand" title="Hollywood Reacts to President Obama&apos;s Same-Sex Marriage Stand!">[2]</a> (And no, I don't think that makes her sound religious.)

She also participated in the NOH8 campaign which is a charity in response to the passage of Proposition 8, a California ballot measure which make gay marriage illegal, that aims to promote marriage equality. Like other celebrity supporters, she appears in a photograph for the organization with duct tape over her mouth and NOH8 written on her cheek.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noh8campaign.com%2Fphoto-gallery%2Ffamiliar-faces-part-2%2Fphoto%2F14255" title="Familiar Faces Part 2.">[3]</a>
