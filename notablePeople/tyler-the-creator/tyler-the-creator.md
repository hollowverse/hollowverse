Tyler, The Creator, born Tyler Okonma in Los Angeles, doesn't appear to have any significant religious background. There is evidence that his family has roots in Christiantiy based on a story he tells of his grandma (which indicates some answers to other questions about Tyler's beliefs). He says:

>My grandmother once told me I was from hell, since I was so evil. I kinda took that and flipped it. Since I didn't have a father, I sorta went to 'this devil guy' as a role model.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fcakesandbrains.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F12%2Ftyler-creator-presentsbastard.html" title="Tyler, The Creator Presents: BASTARD">[1]</a>

Tyler is frequently accused of being a devil or Satan worshiper, and he sort of encourages it with album liner notes that say things like: "Sold my soul to the devil for 30% off." Plus, admitting that he sees the devil as a role model doesn't help. But he insists that he isn't really a Satan worshiper, just an antagonist of religion, saying:

>I don't worship the devil, I just hate religion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.coolehmag.com%2FfrontEnd%2Finterview.php%3Fi%3D51%26s%3D101" title="You Can&apos;t Blame The Youth">[2]</a>

Tyler's even kind enough to say why he hates religion, saying:

>[Religion] keeps people in a box and won't allow them to do what the fuck they want.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.complex.com%2Fmusic%2F2011%2F05%2F10-facts-we-learned-about-tyler-the-creator-from-formspring%2310" title="Q&amp;A: 10 Facts We Learned About Tyler, The Creator From Formspring">[3]</a>

Tyler is a confirmed atheist and, in classic Tyler, The Creator hilarious fashion, he says of Jesus:

>THAT NIGGA IS NOT REAL.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.complex.com%2Fmusic%2F2011%2F05%2F10-facts-we-learned-about-tyler-the-creator-from-formspring%2310" title="Q&amp;A: 10 Facts We Learned About Tyler, The Creator From Formspring">[4]</a>

## The Politics of Controversy

Tyler, The Creator's politics is all about controversy. His lyrics have gotten him called a homophobic misogynist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fcampusprogress.org%2Farticles%2Ftyler_the_creator_reignites_debate_about_misogyny_in_music%2F" title="Tyler, the Creator Reignites Debate About Misogyny in Music.">[5]</a> But Tyler insists it's harmless wordplay and plays it off like a good-natured poke at the ridiculousness of political correctness. He says:

>I have gay fans. They don't really take it offensive, so I don't know. If it offends you, it offends you. If you call me a nigger. I really don't care, but that's just me, personally. Some people might take it the other way; I personally don't give a shit.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fflavorwire.com%2F187857%2Fwhy-tyler-the-creator-needs-to-grow-up" title="Why Tyler, The Creator Needs to Grow Up">[6]</a>

Regarding mainstream politics, Tyler has thrown a few opinions into the ring, but only a few. There is a video he posted on the day before the 2008 elections where Tyler says he isn't voting for either of the candidates (Obama or McCain) and he is going to move to Canada with his white girlfriend and his mom can't know about it. (He was, of course, 17 and not able to vote anyway.)

However, in the same video, he also calls for a sort of liberal view towards gay people and speaks out against California's Prop 8, the law that sought to make it illegal for homosexuals to marry.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DAgpnxd-ajLA%26feature%3Dplayer_embedded%23!" title="Black Guy Eats Parsnisps With McCain">[7]</a>
