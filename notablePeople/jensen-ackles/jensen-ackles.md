Jensen Ackles was born and raised in Dallas, Texas.

Ackes has said he was raised in a "very religious family."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://supernaturalfansonline.com/2010/05/18/jensen-ackles-dishes-season-6-spoilers-in-sci-fi-news-interview/" title="Jensen Ackles Dishes Season 6 Spoilers in Sci-Fi News Interview">[1]</a> We're quite sure that religion is Christianity of some kind, but not even Ackles will disclose which denomination. He said:

>I consider myself a non-denominational Christian. I grew up in a Bible church and still hold those beliefs very close to me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.portraitmagazine.net/archives/jensenackles2.html" title="Jensen Ackles: Aspects of Ackles">[2]</a>

As it turns out, his bread and butter is playing a religious crusader on the hit TV series, Supernatural, where he spends day and night fighting off demons and apparitions, many of whose origins can be found in Catholic mythology.

We also see Ackles as subscribing to the often-religiously motivated dichotomy of good and evil–and he prays. He said, quite troubled, after the 9/11 attacks on New York City:

>I pray to God that this new evil in our world will be abolished quickly.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0010075/bio" title="Jensen Ackles – Biography">[3]</a>

That's a line that could have come straight off the Supernatural script.


## No time for politics, must kill monsters

Ackles hasn't made any political statements or claimed any party or platform that I can find. But nary a star you will find with more rumors swirling around him–from him being gay<a class="source-citation" href="#http://perezhilton.com/2010-05-16-jensen-ackles-gets-married#.UIA6tRg1Zdg" title="Jensen Ackles Gets Married!">[4]</a> to him being cast in this film or that film<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kc-L3W1K0zw" title="Jared &amp; Jensen Panel">[5]</a> –Ackles could reasonably spend a good portion of his free time confirming or denying rumors.

For the most part, the rumor mill has Ackles pegged as a Republican.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_Jensen_Ackles_a_republican_or_a_democrat" title="Is Jensen Ackles a republican or a democrat">[6]</a> I don't see any reasoning behind it, except maybe for the fact that he's from Texas. On the other hand, his character in Supernatural once called Republican icon "Joe the plumber" a "douche."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.frugal-cafe.com/public_html/frugal-blog/frugal-cafe-blogzone/2011/02/03/liberal-sucker-punches-in-hollywood-conservatives-starting-to-punch-back/" title="Liberal Sucker Punches in Hollywood, Conservatives Starting to Punch Back">[7]</a> But that's more of an indication of the show's writers' political leanings than anything else. Let us know in the comments if you find anything out.
