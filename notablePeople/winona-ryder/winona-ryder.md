Winona Ryder, whose surname at birth was Horowitz, was born in Winona, Minnesota and grew up on a ranch commune in Northern California until age 10 when she moved to Petaluma, California.

Ryder has Jewish ancestry on her father's side, which shouldn't come as too much of a surprise with the last name Horowitz.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fethnicelebs.com%2Fwinona-ryder" title="Winona Ryder.">[1]</a> But that doesn't mean she grew up in the Jewish religion. She said about her parents,

>My father is an atheist. My mother is Buddhist. They encouraged my siblings and me to take the best part of other religions to make our own belief system.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mlquotes.com%2Fauthors%2Fwinona_ryder%2F" title="Winona Ryder Quotes.">[2]</a>

It looks like her own spiritual journey led her down her mother's path, but not in a terribly devout way. She said,

>I still practice Buddhism to a certain extent and I believe in karma.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mlquotes.com%2Fauthors%2Fwinona_ryder%2F" title="Winona Ryder Quotes.">[3]</a>

That's pretty much all we have on Ryder's religious affiliation. Even though she was Jewish enough to solicit a remark from Mel Gibson who called her an "oven-dodger" at a party once,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aceshowbiz.com%2Fnews%2Fview%2Fw0008978.html" title="Winona Ryder Insulted by Mel Gibson at Their First Meeting.">[4]</a> it doesn't seem like Ryder feels too connected to the Jewish faith.


## Hippie to Hollywood

Even though we don't have a whole lot of explicit information about Winona Ryder's political beliefs, there's no doubt that she's liberal. First of all, her upbringing by a Buddhist and an atheist who were friends with beat poet Allen Ginsburg and lived on a commune does not suggest a conservative Republican childhood.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.allamericanspeakers.com%2Fspeakers%2FWynona-Ryder%2F388643" title="Wynona Rider Speaker Bio.">[5]</a>

She also seems to be down with gay people–she was equally offended when Mel Gibson made a "horrible gay joke" about her gay friend as she was about his antisemitic remarks to herself–implying that she would most likely support gay marriage initiatives.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.aceshowbiz.com%2Fnews%2Fview%2Fw0008978.html" title="Winona Ryder Insulted by Mel Gibson at Their First Meeting.">[6]</a>

She also seemed optimistic as the George W. Bush presidency was drawing to a close and that of Obama was beginning:

>I hope that this new time, with Barack Obama. . . let us to leave behind this dark atmosphere which derives from the George Bush government. . . . I feel that everything will change.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwinona-ryder.org%2F2009%2F07%2Fwinona-ryder-america-is-too-much-puritan-but-with-obama-things-will-change%2F" title="Winona Ryder: &quot;America is too much puritan but with Obama things will change.&quot;">[7]</a>

She might not be living on a commune, but she sounds pretty liberal to me.
