Matt Bomer was born and raised just outside of Houston, Texas.

Bomer hasn't stated any of his religious views, though he seems to think that religious tolerance as an institution is important enough to do a PSA about it. He said:

>Religion. Did the hairs on your neck stand up a little? Because it's been a sensitive issue since, oh, the beginning of time. But lately it seems that religious intolerance has been growing… <a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DWmZNwsOC_pk" title="Matt Bomer: Religion PSA (rus sub)">[1]</a>

He goes on to say we should allow each other the right to practice our respective religious beliefs in peace. A worthwhile statement, no? My question is, why does the word "religion" make the hairs on Bomer's neck stand up? Something about it must bother him.

It wouldn't be too surprising if Bomer was a bit antagonistic toward religion, considering he's gay, in a relationship with a man and has three children from surrogate mothers.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Feverythingmattbomer.tumblr.com%2Fpost%2F28835906504%2Fmissmariemay-asked-matts-kids-are-adopted" title="Everything Matt Bomer">[2]</a> That's the sort of "alternative" lifestyle many a religious person (not all, of course) would look down on.


## Sex politics

Bomer's politics–at least so far–seem to revolve around issues concerning the gay community. He attended a reception at the White House, hosted by Barack Obama, for the 2012 LGBT Pride Month,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fobamafoodorama.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F06%2Fpresident-obama-vows-more-progress-on.html" title="President Obama Vows More Progress On Issues At 2012 LGBT Pride Month Reception">[3]</a> and considering the president's stance on gay marriage, it's safe to assume that Bomer is a supporter.

Interestingly, Bomer has a somewhat unique take on homosexuality and society. While many feel that tolerance comes from acknowledgement and bringing issues constantly out into the open, Bomer disagrees. He said:

>What we really have to do is stop the adjective before the job title—whether it's 'black actor,' a 'gay actor' or 'anything actor.' Everybody thinks that equality comes from identifying people, and that's not where equality comes from. Equality comes from treating everybody the same regardless of who they are.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fanthonypeoples.wordpress.com%2F2012%2F07%2F02%2Fthey-said-what-cher-matt-bomer-katy-perry-pat-quinn-meghan-mccain%2F" title="They Said What???">[4]</a>

In a sense, Bomer has become a hero and spokesperson from the gay community, particularly considering he just seems so comfortable with being openly gay–like it's no big deal at all–even though he's lost a couple high-profile acting gigs over it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F10%2F22%2Fmatt-bomer-gay-superman-role-jackie-collins_n_2002885.html" title="Matt Bomer Lost &apos;Superman&apos; Role Because He Is Gay, Says Jackie Collins">[5]</a>
