Kris Humphries was born and raised in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

Humphries is an evangelical Christian. He comes from a religious family–his mother said their "faith in God" carried them through the disastrous Kardashian wedding media extravaganza and subsequent divorce filing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2011/12/kris-humphries-talks-kim-kardashian-on-good-morning-america.html" title="Kris Humphries &apos;talks&apos; Kim Kardashian&apos; on &apos;Good Morning America.&apos;">[1]</a>

And speaking of his marriage to Kim Kardashian, it was his family's hometown pastor who presided over the religious ceremony. He said that "the couple requested a God-honoring, Christ-centered ceremony."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithgoespop/2011/11/kim-kardashian-and-kris-humphries-meet-with-pastor/" title="Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries Meet With Pastor.">[2]</a> Regardless of the couple's intention, it only took 72 days for the marriage to fall apart, but the idea of a divorce didn't sit well with Humphries and his devotion to God. According to one source, the basketball star wanted the marriage to end in annulment rather than divorce for religious reasons.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.christianpost.com/news/kris-humphries-seeks-annulment-for-religious-reasons-63839/" title="Kris Humphries Seeks Annulment for Religious Reasons.">[3]</a>

I wish I had anything other than his Kardashian wedding to go on with his faith, but that seems to be the only reason anyone has interviewed him since he became involved with the reality TV family. No matter how many baskets you score or rebounds you catch, it's hard to outshine the Kardashians.


## Caring enough to turn on the TV

Humphries doesn't appear to pay any attention to politics. Maybe he considers himself a Republican because he's opposed to tax hikes on the rich. After all, who could blame him for wanting to hang onto as much of his $8 million net worth as possible.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-athletes/nba/kris-humphries-net-worth/" title="Kris Humphries Net Worth.">[4]</a> Or maybe he's a Democrat and feels a kindred spirit in Obama since they're both mixed-race celebrities with white moms and black dads.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.realitytea.com/tag/kris-humphries-race/" title="Kris Humphries Race.">[5]</a> But this is all conjecture.

We do know that Humphries will have intimate experience with the workings of the justice system in the U.S. after this whole Kardashian annulment or divorce thing concludes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://kysdc.com/2882756/kanye-west-dragged-into-court-by-kris-humphries/" title="Kanye West Dragged Into Court By Kris Humphries.">[6]</a> And we know that he cared enough about the presidential election in 2012 to turn on the TV to see who won.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/KrisHumphries/status/266032074048299008" title="Kris Humphries: Bad info. Just got in front …">[7]</a>

But despite all this speculation, I think it's safe to stick with the non-political label for Kris Humphries.
