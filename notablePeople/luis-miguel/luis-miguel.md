Luis Miguel Gallego Basteri, better known by his first two names, was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico and grew up in Veracruz, Mexico.

Miguel is notoriously guarded about his private life,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/music/5662641-421/luis-miguel-opening-up.html" title="Usually reserved, Latin pop hitmaker Luis Miguel cuts loose.">[1]</a> unfortunately for us over here at the Hollowverse. But, he's just got to be Catholicâ€“at least a lapsed one. The list of Catholic countries associated with the singer are impressive. He was born in Puerto Rico (85% Catholic),<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.puertorico.com/culture/religion/" title="Religion in Puerto Rico.">[2]</a> raised in Mexico (83% Catholic),<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Mexico" title="Religion in Mexico.">[3]</a> has a mother born in Italy (88% Catholic)<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Italy" title="Religion in Italy.">[4]</a> and a father born in Spain (70% Catholic).<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Spain" title="Religion in Spain.">[5]</a> That all adds up to a 326% chance that he's Catholic!

No, but seriously. I'm not the only one that is inferring some sort of relationship with the Catholic church based on nothing that we'd consider a "fact." He's listed as a Catholic on just about every website that would care about such things.<a class="source-citation" href="http://lists.lucywho.com/roman-catholic-celebrities-c19254569/l.html" title="List of Roman Catholic celebrities.">[6]</a> So, we'll have to conclude with: probably Catholic, degree of devotion unknown.

If you think Miguel's private private life means we don't know anything about his politics either, you'd be right. It appears that he's probably a citizen of both the U.S. and Mexico,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Luis-Miguel/biography/" title="Luis Miguel Biography.">[7]</a> but not surprisingly, he doesn't have anything to say about either country.

He's involved in at least some charity work,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.latingossip.com/luis-miguel/luis-miguel-concert-raises-funds-for-childrens-hospital.html" title="Luis Miguel Singing For Children&apos;s Hospital.">[8]</a> but nothing that would be considered even remotely political. It looks like Miguel is just going to be a dead end. If you happen upon something that might help us out, please leave us a note in the comments. Thanks!
