Rob Dyrdek was born and raised in Kettering, Ohio.

As far as I can tell, Dyrdek appears to be vaguely Christian. He doesn't talk about his faith a whole lot, but every once in a while he'll throw a little God into an interview or a tweet. When asked how he was able to get so good at skateboarding so fast, he responded,

>God's plan. . . . I quit high school to be a pro skateboarder out of Ohio, which is just asinine, but it was meant to be.<a class="source-citation" href="http://espn.go.com/espn/thelife/videogames/news/story?id=3672170" title="Skate 2: Rob Dyrdek interview.">[1]</a>

He also retweeted this little happy little note:

>God bless skateboarding, God bless America!!!<a class="source-citation" href="http://tweetwood.com/robdyrdek/tweet/288410376096329728" title="Rob Dyrdek tweets.">[2]</a>

But then after he became a minister at the non-denominational Universal Life Church Monastery in order to officiate his sister's wedding, he didn't seem to take the ordination all that seriously. When one of his friends questioned his new title on his reality TV show, Dyrdek replied,

>This isn't a joke. The state of California recognizes me, Robert Dyrdek, as a man of. . . divinity.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/4/prweb9367144.htm" title="Rob Dyrdek Becomes a Minister, Marries Sister on MTV&apos;s Fantasy Factory.">[3]</a>

And then he rode a zip line wearing a cassock.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2012/4/prweb9367144.htm" title="Rob Dyrdek Becomes a Minister, Marries Sister on MTV&apos;s Fantasy Factory.">[4]</a> But just because he makes fun of religion, doesn't mean he's not religious, or that he doesn't at least believe in God.


## Let Your Voice Be Heard

Dyrdek's politics are far more vague. He encouraged his Twitter followers to vote on Election Day in 2012, but did not give us a clue as to who he was voting for. He wrote:

>Myself and my man @rubenfleischer want to remind everybody to get out and vote!! Let your voice be heard!<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/robdyrdek/status/265939040484864000" title="robdyrdek: Myself and my man @rubenfleischer …">[5]</a>

He did accidentally show up at an anti-Prop 8 rally in Los Angeles.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.skateallcities.com/wordpress/blog/2008/11/no-on-prop-8-march-with-rob-big-los-angeles-ca/" title="No On Prop 8 March with Rob Dyrdek.">[6]</a> (Proposition 8 was the ballot measure that made gay marriage illegal in California until a federal court ruled the law unconstitutional.) But it's tough to call that an endorsement of any liberal causes.

He wore a t-shirt on his TV show that had machine guns all over it,<a class="source-citation" href="http://nycitygurl.wordpress.com/2007/08/21/whats-thats-shirt-rob-dyrdek-wears-with-the-guns/" title="What&apos;s Thats Shirt Rob Dyrdek Wears With The Guns?">[7]</a> so maybe that makes him pro-gun. Or maybe he was trying to be ironic. Regardless, his position on guns definitely doesn't peg him to any particular political party, especially since he wore it well before the country became interested in gun control after the Sandy Hook elementary school shooting in 2012.

We know he voted for someone, but the jury's still out on Rob Dyrdek. If you have any information we don't, let us know in the comments.
