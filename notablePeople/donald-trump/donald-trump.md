Donald Trump grew up in Forest Hills, New York, a suburb of New York City. He's a New Yorker through and through.

He's extremely complicated, both religiously and politically. He's been reported to have been a Catholic, a member of the Dutch Reformed Church, a Presbyterian and he married his third wife in an Episcopalian church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump#Political_activity" title="Donald Trump">[1]</a>

In his most recent interviews about religion, he's said he is Presbyterian:

>I believe in God. I am Christian. I think The Bible is certainly, it is THE book..First Presbyterian Church in Jamaica Queens is where I went to church. I'm a Protestant, I'm a Presbyterian. And you know I've had a good relationship with the church over the years. I think religion is a wonderful thing. I think my religion is a wonderful religion.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52942.html" title="Donald Trump talks religion: &apos;I am Christian.&apos;">[2]</a>

But Trump's an important man, he's a busy man. He's got lots of people to fire and lots of younger women to marry. He's said:

>[I go to church] as much as I can. Always on Christmas. Always on Easter. Always when there's a major occasion. And during the Sundays. I'm a Sunday church person. I'll go when I can.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52942.html" title="Donald Trump talks religion: &apos;I am Christian.&apos;">[3]</a>

As many churches as he's been a part of, it seems that Trump isn't really all that tolerant of other religions. He said of Muslims and the Koran:

>There's a lot of hatred there that's someplace. Now I don't know if that's from the Koran. I don't know if that's from someplace else but there's tremendous hatred out there that I've never seen anything like it. So, you have two views. You have the view that the Koran is all about love and then you have the view that the Koran is, that there's a lot of hate in the Koran.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.mediaite.com/tv/religious-scholar-donald-trump-claims-the-koran-teaches-a-very-negative-vibe/" title="Religious Scholar? Donald Trump Claims The Koran &quot;Teaches a Very Negative Vibe">[4]</a>

He's also said:

>Unfortunately, at this moment in time, there is a Muslim problem in the world.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.islamophobiatoday.com/2011/03/31/donald-trump-says-there-is-a-muslim-problem-wants-obama%E2%80%99s-birth-certificate/" title="Donald Trump Says there is a Muslim Problem, Wants Obama&apos;s Birth Certificate">[5]</a>

Dude, you're so fired from talking.


## Trump's hair for president

Politically, Trump's as confused as he is religiously. He has talked about running for president a few times as well as for the governor of New York, but he's never actually done it.

One time, he wanted to run as a third-party candidate for the Reform Party.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ontheissues.org/Donald_Trump.htm" title="Donald Trump">[6]</a>

In 2001, he registered with the Democratic Party.<a class="source-citation" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/trump_through_the_years_1.html" title="Donald Trump vs. Donald Trump: The Difference a Decade Makes">[7]</a>

Most recently, he's identified with the Republicans and he's come out on the conservative side with issues like abortion (even though he supported it for many years) and gay marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2011/02/trump_through_the_years_1.html" title="Donald Trump vs. Donald Trump: The Difference a Decade Makes">[8]</a>

On CNN, Trump said he's more Democrat than Republican and that George W. Bush was

>..probably the worst president in the history of the United States.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-17/politics/donald.trump.issues_1_gop-presidential-hopefuls-conservative-political-action-conference-presidential-bid?_s=PM:POLITICS" title="Is Trump &apos;flip-flopping&apos; or &apos;evolving?&apos;">[9]</a>

Then on Fox News, he said:

>I'm a very conservative person. I'm very big into the military. I'm a great guy for defense. I am probably as conservative as anybody on your show, and that's going a pretty strong stepâ€¦I'm a very conservative Republican. I believe strongly in just about all conservative principles.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-17/politics/donald.trump.issues_1_gop-presidential-hopefuls-conservative-political-action-conference-presidential-bid?_s=PM:POLITICS" title="Is Trump &apos;flip-flopping&apos; or &apos;evolving?&apos;">[10]</a>

He explains his endless back-and-forth, saying:

>I'm very much independent in that way. I go for the person, not necessarily the party. I mean, I vote for Republicans and I vote for Democrats.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-17/politics/donald.trump.issues_1_gop-presidential-hopefuls-conservative-political-action-conference-presidential-bid?_s=PM:POLITICS" title="Is Trump &apos;flip-flopping&apos; or &apos;evolving?&apos;">[11]</a>

I don't know man. You might want to stick to skyscrapers, firing people, and getting married because it doesn't seem like you know at all what you're talking about.
