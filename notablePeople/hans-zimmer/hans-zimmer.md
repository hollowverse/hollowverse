Hans Zimmer was born in Frankfurt, Germany and grew up in Königstein im Taunus, Germany and London, England.

I couldn't find any indication that Hans Zimmer considers himself religious or not religious or mildly religious or anything. Some people seem to think that Christians shouldn't listen to Zimmer,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110104194944AAkspXN" title="If your a christian, is listening to Hans Zimmer bad?">[1]</a> but I couldn't really figure out why.

In his home country of Germany, more people are Christians than anything else, so it would make sense that he was raised in some sort of Christian home. However, 34% of Germans say they don't affiliate with any religion, and I would say it's just as likely that he's part of that group.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Germany" title="Religion in Germany.">[2]</a>

Zimmer has equally little to say about politics–or probably more accurately, reporters are equally uninterested in asking him questions about it. I found nothing about his opinion of politics in Germany or the rest of Europe, including his country's leading role in the debt crisis there. And I couldn't find anything about his take on American politics, the country in which he lives.

He did express his horror at the tragic shooting in an Aurora, Colorado movie theater which killed 12 people, and took place during a movie for which he composed the soundtrack. On his Facebook page he wrote,

>I am devastated by this tragedy, and my heart is with the victims, survivors and their loved ones. Words fail me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hans-zimmer-james-holmes-aurora-shooting-355909" title="Hans Zimmer Composes Song for Aurora Shooting Victims.">[3]</a>

He might not have said anything about gun control, but he did compose a song called "Aurora," all the proceeds of which he donated to a charity dedicated to providing relief for the victims.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hans-zimmer-james-holmes-aurora-shooting-355909" title="Hans Zimmer Composes Song for Aurora Shooting Victims.">[4]</a>

It's possible that Zimmer is entirely non-religious and non-political, but I think it's more likely that Zimmer's role in popular culture doesn't lend itself to in-depth interviews about his personal views of the world. The media tend to save that for the pretty faces on the screen, and less for the craftsmen behind the scenes. If you have any information to help us out, let us know in the comments.
