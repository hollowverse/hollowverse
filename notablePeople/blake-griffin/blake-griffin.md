Blake Griffin was born and raised in and around Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.

Griffin is a devout evangelical (or born-again) Christian who considers himself "saved" since age six.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nebraskafca.org%2Funcategorized%2Fgriffin-leaves-mark-on-ncaa%2F" title="Griffin leaves mark on NCAA">[1]</a> He and his brother, Taylor, were home schooled until Blake was in eighth grade. His father, a pastor,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2011%2F02%2Fthe-new-slam-dunk-christian%2F" title="The new slam-dunk Christian">[2]</a> said:

>[Home schooling] gave them a foundation. We've deviated [in America] from our past to where we are right now. Here's a nation founded on the opportunity for freedom of religion, and every time you look around, there's people saying God has to be taken out of this, out of this.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fokschoolchoice.blogspot.com%2F2009%2F03%2Fhomeschooling-gave-blake-griffin.html" title="Homeschooling gave Blake Griffin a &apos;foundation.&apos;">[3]</a>

After the home schooling came to a close, Griffin finished out the rest of high school at Oklahoma Christian School.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbrandondutcher.blogspot.com%2F2008%2F10%2Fgriffin-brothers-are-all-grown-up.html" title="The Griffin Brothers Are All Grown Up">[4]</a> And when he went to college and made the basketball team, he quickly joined the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nebraskafca.org%2Funcategorized%2Fgriffin-leaves-mark-on-ncaa%2F" title="Griffin leaves mark on NCAA">[5]</a>

After a successful college career, Griffin made the number 1 draft pick to the NBA's Los Angeles Clippers. During pre-season, however, he broke his kneecap and couldn't play his first NBA season. But God came to the rescue of Griffin's attitude. Blake said:

>I was just excited about the opportunity to play in the NBA. I was ready to go, but everything came crashing down, so to speak. But these things happen. That was God's way of just humbling me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sportsspectrum.com%2Farticles%2FNBACloseupBlakeGriffin-February2011.php" title="NBA Close-Up (Blake Griffin)">[6]</a>

It clearly worked out, because at the publishing of this article, Griffin is one of the most celebrated young players in basketball.


## B-ball and presidential politics

Blake seems largely non-political. It would be a fallacy to assume his devotion to Christianity would dictate a conservative political position, but it does happen from time to time.

One thing we do know about Griffin is that Obama is watching him. The president, a big fan of professional basketball, said of Griffin:

>Blake Griffin is unbelievable… the only thing is you got to tell Blake to just take that 12-15-footer when he gets it because he's got a good stroke, but he always looks like he's hesitating a little bit because he wants to go inside. And if he starts getting that shot like Karl Malone, he'll be unstoppable.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Flosangeles.sbnation.com%2Flos-angeles-clippers%2F2012%2F3%2F1%2F2835894%2Fbarack-obama-bill-simmons-podcast-transcript-chris-paul-blake-griffin-clipper" title="Barack Obama Discusses Chris Paul, Blake Griffin &amp; Clippers On Bill Simmons Podcast">[7]</a>

No response from Griffin that I could find… maybe he really is a conservative. Give us your thoughts in the comments.
