Nicole Scherzinger was born in Honolulu, Hawaii and grew up in Louisville, Kentucky.

Scherzinger is a strong Catholic. Her grandfather is a priest in the church, Scherzinger says she prays before every performance<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandpopfeatures/8681426/Nicole-Scherzinger-Im-an-alpha-female.html" title="Nicole Scherzinger: &apos;I&apos;m an alpha female.&apos;">[1]</a> and she never misses a Sunday Mass.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0816/scherzingern.html" title="Nicole Scherzinger is a devout catholic">[2]</a>

Scherzinger admits there has been some contention in her family regarding her racy outfits and sexually charged performances. But still, her conservative family is supportive of her career. She said:

>I still listen to my mom, and my grandfather is a priest! They weren't too excited when they saw the covers of magazines where my back was nude… For the most part my family have been very supportive of me. They know where my heart lies and what my faith is and that I'm still grounded. They go to my shows. My grandfather in his priest outfit, had pictures taken with all of the Pussycat Dolls.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.postzambia.com/post-read_article.php?articleId=16501" title="Nicole Scherzinger&apos;s family hate her raunchy stage outfits">[3]</a>

Supportive or not, Scherzinger's mom doesn't like the name of her band, "The Pussycat Dolls."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rte.ie/ten/2011/0816/scherzingern.html" title="Nicole Scherzinger is a devout catholic">[4]</a> Strange, it's so… catchy.


## Yes we can

For a brief time, it appeared that Scherzinger had made a drastic break from her entertainment industry counterparts and sided with Ron Paul during his 2012 presidential campaign. The following message suddenly appeared on her Twitter feed:

>For the first time ever a politician isn't lying to us. WAKE UP AMERICA! Ron Paul 2012 I Love this Guy #RonPaulRevolution!<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/nicole-scherzinger.html" title="Nicole Scherzinger">[5]</a>

That certainly would have been something to talk about, but many a horny Ron Paul supporter was disappointed to learn that her Twitter account had been hacked by a maverick Ron Paul advocacy organization–along with the Twitter accounts of Interscope label-mates Gwen Stefani and the band Rise Against.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/no-doubt-nicole-scherzinger-twitter-accounts-hacked-20120111" title="No Doubt, Nicole Scherzinger Twitter Accounts Hacked">[6]</a>

As it turns out, Scherzinger fits right in with the majority of her comrades in the entertainment business and is an Obama supporter. Along with a slew of other famous singers and actors including Will.I.Am, Common and Scarlett Johansson, Scherzinger made the Obama-supporting 2008 music video, Yes We Can.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfj8USN-jyY" title="Nicole Scherzinger – Yes We Can (Political Ad 2008)">[7]</a>

Beyond that, Scherzinger devotes most of her society-improving energy to politically safe charities like The National Breast Cancer Foundation<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/news/1314-pussycat-dolls-head-to-australia-for-charity-gig" title="Pussycat Dolls Head To Australia For Charity Gig">[8]</a> and an organization to benefit kids with Down Syndrome.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/news/4284-nicole-scherzinger-plans-special-needs-charity-camp" title="Nicole Scherzinger Plans Special Needs Charity Camp">[9]</a>
