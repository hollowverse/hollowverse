Miranda Kerr was born Sydney, Australia and grew up in Gunnedah, New South Wales, Australia.

Kerr's Australian upbringing and her English, Scottish, and French family heritage<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justjared.com%2F2009%2F09%2F11%2Fmiranda-kerrs-biggest-runway-mishap-flying-shoe%2F" title="Miranda Kerr&apos;s Biggest Runway Mishap? Flying Shoe!">[1]</a> imply an undoubtedly Christian tradition. However, Kerr went off her European religious rails and took up Nichiren Buddhism.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Ffaithgoespop%2F2011%2F11%2Fhey-did-you-know-miranda-kerr-is-buddhist-and-an-aries%2F" title="Hey, Did You Know Miranda Kerr Is Buddhist?">[2]</a> Coincidentally, Kerr's famous husband, Orlando Bloom, is also a Nichiren Buddhist, both of whom, and both are members of the Japanese branch of Buddhism called Soka Gakkai International.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fethnicelebs.com%2Fmiranda-kerr" title="Miranda Kerr">[3]</a> It's unclear if one influenced the other or it was a commonality that helped to move along their courtship.

Kerr actively practices her religion, chanting for 20 minutes twice daily, practicing yoga and meditation, and reading widely on topics of spirituality. She said:

>I believe that everyone is looking for the answers, but the answers are within ourselves. Buddhism feels right for me… I believe we're all equal and we all have our purpose in life. We all have our karma that we need to fulfill and I'm here fulfilling mine.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20071211001041%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.news.com.au%2Fdailytelegraph%2Fstory%2F0%2C22049%2C22730119-5006011%2C00.html" title="Miranda&apos;s model life">[4]</a>

I predict many frat boys converting to Nichiren Buddhism in the very near future.


## Green politics

Kerr wants to make a difference in the world. Wisely listening to her father, Kerr realized that this may be difficult if she sticks only to modeling. She said:

>I've always had a burning desire to help people and make a difference in the world. I didn't know how I could do that in modelling when it can be such a fake world. But my dad told me I could make a difference by being true to myself and teaching people what I've learned about spirituality, health and nutrition.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20071211001041%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.news.com.au%2Fdailytelegraph%2Fstory%2F0%2C22049%2C22730119-5006011%2C00.html" title="Miranda&apos;s model life">[5]</a>

…And environmentalism. Kerr has played up her strengths for the cause of a greener world, appearing nude and chained to a tree on the cover of Rolling Stone to promote the cause of saving the trees for Australia's koala bears.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.treehugger.com%2Fculture%2F7-hot-female-models-who-are-also-environmentalists.html" title="7 Hot Female Models Who Are Also Environmentalists">[6]</a> Furthermore, she was the global ambassador for the Earth Hour program,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailygreen.com%2Fgoing-green%2Ftips%2Fearth-hour-47032002" title="Earth Hour Ambassador Miranda Kerr">[7]</a> an organization set up to shine light (pun intended) on environmental issues by asking everyone in the world to turn off their lights for one hour per year.

I predict many frat boys spending an hour drinking in the dark in the very near future.
