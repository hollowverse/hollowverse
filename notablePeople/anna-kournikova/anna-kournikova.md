Anna Kournikova was born in Moscow, USSR and raised there during its reconversion to Moscow, Russia.

Kournikova is reported to be of the Russian Orthodox persuasion. Many separate websites make this claim.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.fanpix.net/gallery/anna-kournikova-pictures.htm" title="Anna Kournikova Pictures">[1]</a> However, Kournikova herself has not, as far as I can tell, confirmed this. We do know that she considers herself Christian. To a presumptuous reporter who assumed she is Jewish and said "Mazel Tov" to her in regards to her engagement to Enrique Iglesias, Kournikova replied:

>I am not Jewish – can't you see my cross?<a class="source-citation" href="http://perezhilton.com/2009-07-12-anna-kournikova-is-not-jewish-guys#.UMPeeIUZ-Bg" title="Anna Kournikova Is Not Jewish, Guys">[2]</a>

She is often pictured wearing a cross. She is also famously quoted as saying about her rigorous tennis regimen:

>God gives all to those, who get up early.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.searchquotes.com/Anna_Kournikova/Religion/quotes/" title="Anna Kournikova Religion Quotes">[3]</a>

But other than that, this bombshell tennis player seems largely unconcerned with religion. This isn't surprising, considering her upbringing in the heart of a religiously oppressive regime (Soviet Russia). Plus, she's got other things on her mind. Kournikova is the proud owner of quotes like:

>I'm like a menu at an expensive restaurant, you can look at me, but you can't afford me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468045/bio" title="Anna Kournikova – Biography">[4]</a>

And:

>I'm beautiful, famous and gorgeous.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0468045/bio" title="Anna Kournikova – Biography">[5]</a>

Beautiful and gorgeous? That's gotta be sweet.


## Politics and Sports

Kournikova is not the most political person either. She became a U.S. citizen in 2010<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/tennis-star-anna-kournikova-becomes-us-citizen-poses-for-october-issue-of-maxim" title="Tennis star Anna Kournikova becomes US citizen, poses for October issue of Maxim">[6]</a> but only seems concerned with politics when it involves athletics in some way. She has commented on Michelle Obama's tone physique<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1004/kournikova_a_humanitarian_at_heart.html" title="Anna Kournikova, a humanitarian at heart">[7]</a> and when asked if she is offended that President Obama seems to favor basketball over any other sport, she said:

>That's great! As long as our president emphasizes sports and plays any kind of sport — whether it's soccer or it's basketball — that's great. Obviously, it would be amazing if it were tennis, but whatever sport it is.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1004/kournikova_a_humanitarian_at_heart.html" title="Anna Kournikova, a humanitarian at heart">[8]</a>

But that's about the extent of it–no endorsements, financial contributions or comments on social issues to be found.
