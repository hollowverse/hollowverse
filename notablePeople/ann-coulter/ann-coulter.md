Ann Coulter was born in New York City and was raised in New Canaan, Connecticut.

This may come as a surprise to some of you, but Ann Coulter is a conservative Republican–or more accurately an anti-liberal. Well, I suppose if you had come across one of her many books in a bookstore, the titles may have given you a clue. There's If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans; How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must); and Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America to name a few. Oh, but we're getting ahead of ourselves. Let us start where we always start.


## The Church of Ann Coulter

Coulter's father was a devout Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=29488" title="John Vincent Coulter.">[1]</a> and her mother, who came from Puritan ancestry,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.cleburnetimesreview.com/opinion/x489014686/Ann-Coulter-Saying-a-farewell-to-my-biggest-fan-my-mom" title="Ann Coulter: Saying a farewell to my biggest fan, my mom.">[2]</a> appears to have been some kind of Protestant.

Coulter is a devout Christian, but as far as I can tell, she doesn't associate with any particular denomination. Coulter's brand of Christianity does not have a strong emphasis on the "be nice to people" factor. She said Jesus' "distinctive message" was:

>People are sinful and need to be redeemed, and this is your lucky day because I'm here to redeem you even though you don't deserve it, and I have to get the crap kicked out of me to do it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2004/03/04/the_passion_of_the_liberal/page/2" title="The passion of the liberal – Ann Coulter.">[3]</a>

In other words, Jesus was a lot more like her than, say, Mother Teresa.

And Coulter shows remarkably little tolerance for those who disagree with her religious beliefs. In talking about how much better it would be if all Americans were Christians, she said she wants "Jews to be perfected, as they say."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/10/11/national/main3358373.shtml" title="Coulter: We Want Jews To Be &quot;Perfected.&quot;">[4]</a> She said one of the tenets of Islam was to "kill everyone who doesn't smell bad and doesn't answer to the name Mohammed."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://townhall.com/columnists/anncoulter/2004/03/04/the_passion_of_the_liberal" title="The passion of the liberal – Ann Coulter.">[5]</a> Regarding the scientific worldview she said she wants "evolution to join the roster of other discredited religions."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.humanevents.com/2006/06/06/emexclusive-interview-emcoulter-says-book-examines-mental-disorder-of-liberalism/" title="Exclusive Interview: Coulter Says Book Examines &apos;Mental Disorder&apos; of Liberalism.">[6]</a> And when asked why she thinks the Episcopal church is "barely a church" she said,

>Because it's become increasingly difficult to distinguish the pronouncements of the Episcopal Church from the latest Madonna video.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2006/08/Church-Militant-Ann-Coulter-On-God-Faith-And-Liberals.aspx?p=2" title="Church Militant: Ann Coulter on God, Faith, and Liberals.">[7]</a>

She may be lacking specificity, but point taken. Her religion is deeply important to her personal and professional life:

>Christianity fuels everything I write. Being a Christian means that I am called upon to do battle against lies, injustice, cruelty, hypocrisy—you know, all the virtues in the church of liberalism.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.humanevents.com/2006/06/06/emexclusive-interview-emcoulter-says-book-examines-mental-disorder-of-liberalism/" title="Exclusive Interview: Coulter Says Book Examines &apos;Mental Disorder&apos; of Liberalism.">[8]</a>

## Speaking of the church of liberalism. . .

Ann Coulter makes a living from bashing liberals–it's something she says she greatly enjoys<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.humanevents.com/2006/06/06/emexclusive-interview-emcoulter-says-book-examines-mental-disorder-of-liberalism/" title="Exclusive Interview: Coulter Says Book Examines &apos;Mental Disorder&apos; of Liberalism.">[9]</a> –and she takes a conservative/Republican position on just about everything, except incidentally her [music tastes](http://www.jambands.com/features/2006/06/23/deadheads-are-what-liberals-claim-to-be-but-aren-t-an-interview-with-ann-coulter).

To run down a partial list of positions, Coulter is opposed to abortion except in the case of rape and incest;<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.anncoulter.com/columns/2012-11-07.html" title="Ann Coulter – November 7, 2012 – DON&apos;T BLAME ROMNEY.">[10]</a> she is opposed to gun control;<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u5niWYA3Tw" title="Ann Coulter: Why Can&apos;t We Publish List Of Women Who Get Abortions?">[11]</a> she is pro-torture;<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkJCMqarN98" title="Ann Coulter loves the Patriot Act, Torture; Regime Change in Iraq for their natural resources.">[12]</a> she supported the Iraq component of the War on Terror in part because of the country's rich oil resources;<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HkJCMqarN98" title="Ann Coulter loves the Patriot Act, Torture; Regime Change in Iraq for their natural resources.">[13]</a> she thinks the death penalty is an "absolute necessity;"<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2006/08/Church-Militant-Ann-Coulter-On-God-Faith-And-Liberals.aspx?p=2" title="Church Militant: Ann Coulter on God, Faith, and Liberals.">[14]</a> and she opposes both gay marriage and civil unions for gay couples.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://neighborhoods.redeyechicago.com/lincoln-park/news-report/2011/06/02/ann-coulter-speech-at-depaul-divides-opinion/" title="Ann Coulter speech at DePaul divides students.">[15]</a>

She has an interesting take on feminism–in short, she's not a fan. And she thinks liberal women are ugly.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://dailycaller.com/2012/02/10/coulter-on-feminism-all-pretty-girls-are-right-wingers/" title="Coulter on feminism: &apos;All pretty girls are right-winger.&apos;">[16]</a> But, in all seriousness, she did say,

>It would be a much better country if women did not vote. That is simply a fact. In fact, in every presidential election since 1950–except Goldwater in '64–the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/anncoulter452163.html" title="I would be a much better…">[17]</a>

And, like I said before, she spends probably more time railing against liberals than she does explicitly outlining her Republican worldview. She believes that liberal beliefs are anti-American and a threat to the country. She said,

>Whether they are defending the Soviet Union or bleating for Saddam Hussein, liberals are always against America. They are either traitors or idiots, and on the matter of America's self-preservation, the difference is irrelevant.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/a/anncoulter160231.html" title="Whether they are defending the…">[18]</a>

Ann Coulter has opinions on so many more things, and has so many more amazing quotes than I could do justice to in this article. If you're interested in learning more, her [website](http://www.anncoulter.com/) is a good place to start. But, just to make sure you've got her priorities straight, I'll leave you with a few more words from Coulter herself:

>I'm a Christian first and a mean-spirited, bigoted conservative second, and don't you ever forget it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.editorandpublisher.com/Headlines/Article/Coulter-Press-Either-Incompetent-or-Full-of-Left-Wing-Bias-" title="Coulter: Press Either &apos;Incompetent&apos; or Full of &apos;Left-Wing Bias.&apos;">[19]</a>

Amen.
