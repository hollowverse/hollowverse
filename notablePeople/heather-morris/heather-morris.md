Heather Morris was born in Thousand Oaks, California and grew up in Scottsdale, Arizona.

Morris is clearly a religious person, somewhere in the Christian tradition. If I had to guess, I'd say she's a Catholic. But let's not guess.

Morris has, not one but two, angel tattoos.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm3529987/bio" title="Heather Morris (III) – Biography">[1]</a> Combine that with her "dream board," a poster she made with the organization Live! Starring… You! that outlines her dreams and aspirations in pictures. Morris included many career-related items on her dream board such as working her desire to work in a James Cameron film or to make her own film. But she drew a big cross on it as well and when pointing to it, she said "…because I love God."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dc0v6fToGWE&feature=player_embedded" title="Glee Star Heather Morris shares her &quot;Dream Board.&quot;">[2]</a>

Also, she indicated a definite belief in an afterlife. When speaking about the death of her father, she said:

>It's something that is hard for me, because I'm sad about it, but I don't dwell on it. I know he's in a better place, instead of suffering.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.hollyscoop.com/heather-morris/5-things-you-didnt-know-about-glees-heather-morris.html" title="5 Things You DIdn&apos;t Know About Glee&apos;s Heather Morris">[3]</a>

So, to recap, she's an angel-sporting, cross-drawing, God-loving young lady. We'll be filing her under ambiguous Christian.


## Homopolitical

Morris is pretty non-political. I couldn't even find a statement about the 2012 presidential election–the equivalent of a nationwide high school talent show/popularity contest! You'd think it would be right up her alley.

Some folks were offended by some artsy photos she did where she was all beat up and bruised, worrying that Morris was somehow advocating domestic violence.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ecorazzi.com/2011/09/05/controversial-bruised-photos-of-heather-morris-to-raise-money-for-charity/" title="Controversial Bruised Photos of Heather Morris to Raise Money For Charity">[4]</a> Seems doubtful anyone would really come out in support of domestic violence, though.

If we could point to anything about Morris that would be vaguely political, it would be her relationship to the gay community. She gets a lot of support from her gay friends and fans and appreciates it. She said:

>Growing up as a dancer, most of my guy friends were gay — or are now learning that they're gay — so it's been very clear in my eyes that they not only love the show but also me in it… I love it that they support me so much.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/television/2010/04/27/heather-morris-its-brittany-gleeks?page=0,2" title="Heather Morris Its Brittany, Gleeks">[5]</a>

I wouldn't want to categorize Morris based on the fact that she has gay friends, but it's a safe bet she's not a social conservative. Let us know if you have any information in the comments.
