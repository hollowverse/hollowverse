Colbie Caillat was born in Malibu, California and grew up in Newbury Park, California.

Although a few speculators around the internet are trying to make Caillat into a lapsed Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_Colbie_Calliats_religion" title="What is Colbie Calliats religion.">[1]</a> there's no reason to believe that's true. She did do a Christmas album, but that's the strongest indication we have that she has at least a semi-Christian background.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://newalbumreleases.net/50186/colbie-caillat-christmas-in-the-sand-2012/" title="Colbie Caillat – Christmas In The Sand (2012).">[2]</a>

But my guess is that she's either generally non-religious or just vaguely spiritual. There's no indication that she's Buddhist, but she retweeted a quote from the Dalai Lama that indicates she's probably not too into organized religion:

>Absolutely… RT @GreatestQuotes "My religion is kindness." – Dalai Lama<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebritytweet.com/ColbieCaillat/link/184289905256562688/" title="Colbie Caillat @colbiecaillat.">[3]</a>

## Bubbly for Obama

Politically, however, Caillat leaves nothing to ambiguity: she's a liberal Democrat and a huge Obama fan. She performed for at least one fundraiser during the lead-up to the 2012 presidential election<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.zimbio.com/pictures/xKWi9ggAtwL/Obama+Speaks+DNC+Fundraiser+Chicago/ZKRCyRPsf58/Colbie+Caillat" title="Colbie Caillat Pictures – Obama Speaks At DNC Fundraiser In Chicago.">[4]</a> and after the president won reelection, she tweeted,

>OBAMA!!!!!! I'm so happy!!!!! Congratulations @BarackObama!!!!!!!!! @MichelleObama!!!!!!!<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/ColbieCaillat/status/266033159399940096" title="ColbieCaillat: OBAMA!!!!!! I&apos;m so happy!!!!! …">[5]</a>

That's a lot of exclamation points. She must have been pretty excited.

She's thrown her support behind a few other liberal causes as well, like gay marriage and environmentalism. About the passing of Proposition 8 in California, which made same-sex marriage illegal, she said,

>I think that it is a shame not to acknowledge the love two people share who want to spend the rest of their lives together.  They should be granted all the rights that married couples have.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.shewired.com/box-office/artists-lilith-fair-series-colbie-caillat-exclusive?page=0,1" title="The Artists of Lilith Fair Series: Colbie Caillat Exclusive.">[6]</a>

She also teamed up with an eco-friendly skincare line, and said she was proud to promote products that are not tested on animals, come in green packing, and are "organic, natural, and good for putting in or on your body."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ecorazzi.com/2012/07/18/colbie-caillat-new-face-of-eco-and-animal-friendly-skincare/" title="Colbie Caillat New Face of Eco and Animal Friendly Skincare.">[7]</a>

I'm sure we'll see more from this young singer in the future. The Democrats are bound to have another celebrity friend for a long time to come.
