## Werewolf politics

Lautner hasn't taken a political stand as of yet. But given his religiosity and the resulting positions on sex and drugs, it's reasonable to assume he's probably a conservative. But the various question and answer sites on the internet seem to agree that Lautner considers himself a Democrat.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-taylor-lautner%27s-political-affiliation" title="What is Taylor Lautner&apos;s political Affiliation">[4]</a>
