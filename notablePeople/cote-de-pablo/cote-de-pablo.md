Cote de Pablo, whose full name is María José de Pablo Fernández, was born in Santiago, Chile. She was raised there and in Miami, Florida.

De Pablo grew up in a Catholic family–no surprise considering her South American roots–and describes her religious upbringing as "strict."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/cote-de-pablo-371009" title="Cote de Pablo.">[1]</a> But it seems that adulthood has led her down a slightly different path.

Although the actress avoids labeling her particular brand of spirituality as Buddhism or anything else, she says there's no doubt that reincarnation is part of the whole spiritual journey:

>I just know that I'm going to be here again. One lifetime is too short to purify my soul. It's going to take a couple of tries.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.prevention.com/health/emotional-health/cote-de-pablo-ncis-star-shares-her-beauty-secrets/11-feeding-her-spirit" title="Cote de Pablo – NCIS star shares her beauty secrets.">[2]</a>

And God is part of the picture as well, but seemingly in a pantheistic way. She said that the existence of God is just as obvious as reincarnation:

>I have moments where I've seen the majestic beauty in nature and the overwhelming perfection of it. To me, there's nothing closer to God than that. It's not something that I can explain. It's just something that you either feel or you don't. So I know that there is a God. To me, there is a very big God out there. Hopefully, I'll get closer to him/her at some point.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.prevention.com/health/emotional-health/cote-de-pablo-ncis-star-shares-her-beauty-secrets/11-feeding-her-spirit" title="Cote de Pablo – NCIS star shares her beauty secrets.">[3]</a>

However you may try to categorize de Pablo's spirituality, it seems to me to be a personal and intimate reflection of the joy and hope she has for life. And it's definitely not Catholic. How about we go with spiritual, not religious for now.


## The A-politics of Hippie-ism

De Pablo's views on politics appear to be a little murkier, or possibly completely non-existent. I couldn't find any comment on American politics, not about immigration reform, gun control, gay marriage, or any other causes du jour. And nothing on Chile or South America either.

But, if I was going to guess, which I do from time to time, I'd say she's most likely fairly liberal. First of all she's a self-described hippie.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.prevention.com/health/emotional-health/cote-de-pablo-ncis-star-shares-her-beauty-secrets/1-finding-her-tribe" title="Cote de Pablo – NCIS star shares her beauty secrets.">[4]</a> I'm not saying that automatically makes her a supporter of big government, but it's certainly a clue. And second, she's a Hollywood actress. Again, there are a few conservative Republicans in that crowd, but statistically speaking, it's pretty unlikely that she'd be one of them.

Then again, she could be completely apolitical–neither left nor right. I suppose that would be the safe bet. If you know of anything I missed, please let us know in the comments!
