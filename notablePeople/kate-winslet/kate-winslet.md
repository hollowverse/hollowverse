Kate Winslet was born and raised in Reading, Berkshire, England.

She doesn't speak much of her religion to the press, even though Winslet has played roles commenting on spirituality throughout her career, including Hideous Kinky in which a mother goes on a spiritual quest to Morocco and Holy Smoke in which her character is spiritually awakened on a trip to India.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thenational.ae/arts-culture/film/kate-winslets-five-most-offbeat-film-roles" title="Kate Winslet&apos;s five most offbeat film roles.">[1]</a>

She does appear, however, to believe that God created her and is responsible for her physical appearance.

>The lord God almighty has done me proud with my features which I'm proud of and have no desire to alter them.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Kate_Winslet" title="Kate Winslet.">[2]</a>

Beyond that the actress has been mostly silent on all things religious, probably indicating that she isn't terribly concerned with it.

Winslet also doesn't appear to be very involved in British politics–aside from being honored by the Queen for her contributions to the arts.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/16/kate-winslet-kenneth-branagh-knighted-royal-honor_n_1602339.html" title="Kate Winslet Honored by Queen Elizabeth II, Kenneth Branagh Knighted.">[3]</a>

There are rumors here and there that she's a Liberal Democrat, but there's not much in the way of confirmation from Winslet herself. In fact, the Lib Dems caused a little stir in the press when they placed a doctored picture of her in a conference brochure, making it falsely appear as though she had attended one of the party's events. A spokeswoman for Winslet said only:

>They did not request permission to use the image and, so far, Kate has not been made aware of its use. I am not aware of her political position.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1160363/Lib-Dems-doctor-Golden-Globes-pictures-Kate-Winslet-conference-brochure.html" title="Lib Dems doctor Golden Globes pictures of Kate Winslet for their conference brochure.">[4]</a>

## Hollywood Politics

That may not have been a raving endorsement, but it would be in line with Winslet's worldview to back the socially liberal party. She seems to agree with them on gay rights at least. When her seven-year-old son asked if she would prefer him to be gay or straight she said,

>My love, that would be entirely up to you, and it doesn't make any difference to me.

She has also been an outspoken critic of the unrealistic physical expectations Hollywood has for female celebrities. Although she struggled with her weight in the past, Winslet says that now she is "sincerely grateful for my buttocks."<a class="source-citation" href="http://skinnyvscurvy.com/then-and-now/kate-winslet-i-sincerely-grateful-buttocks.html" title="Kate Winslet: &quot;I am sincerely grateful for my buttocks.&quot;">[5]</a> She started the British Anti-Cosmetic Surgery League with several fellow actresses in order to further promote natural beauty and fight pressures on women to live up to unrealistic ideals.<a class="source-citation" href="http://fashionetc.com/beauty/celebrity/2769-kate-winslet-british-anti-cosmetic-surgery-league" title="Kate Winslet Forms &apos;British Anti-Cosmetic Surgery League.&apos;">[6]</a>
