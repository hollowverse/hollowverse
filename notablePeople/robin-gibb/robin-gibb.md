Robin Gibb was born in the Isle of Man and grew up largely in Brisbane, Australia. He died in London, England at the age of 62.

What Gibb's religious preferences were is a mystery. It would seem that this is not because of a lack of religious views, but perhaps that they were rather unconventional and therefore, not something Gibbs would be quick to talk about.

His parents were of English stock, so it is highly likely that at the very least, there was a Christian influence in his family, and it's reasonable to assume that the Christian side of things was influenced by the Church of England, an Episcopalian denomination. He did sing the Christian Christmas song, "O Come All Ye Faithful," as a solo artist after all.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lyricsbay.com/o_come_all_ye_faithful_lyrics-robin_gibb.html" title="Robin Gibb – O Come All Ye Faithful Lyrics">[1]</a>

Things get strange when Gibb's family life comes into the picture. It is confirmed that Gibb had an open relationship with his longtime wife, Dwina Murphy Gibb, which is certainly not something your average Christian practices. In fact, Gibb fathered a child with a housekeeper during their marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1138950/Straying-Alive-Married-Bee-Gee-Robin-Gibb-baby-live-housekeeper-26-years-junior.html" title="Straying Alive! Married Bee Gee Robin Gibb has baby with live-in housekeeper 26 years his junior">[2]</a>

Furthermore, Dwina is a bi-sexual Druid priestess who's also known to practice "neo-Hinduism."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/the-pms-wife-the-druid-priestess-and-the-nosex-guru-7081498.html" title="The PM&apos;s wife, the Druid princess and the no-sex guru">[3]</a>

While this certainly points to an open-mindedness on Gibb's part, it doesn't necessarily indicate his spiritual beliefs. I think they are atheistic overall. Listen to what he has to say about death and consciousness:

>If the heart stops for more than two minutes, you have massive brain death. There are only two minutes between our conscious world and zero. That's how fragile our consciousness is.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.searchquotes.com/quotes/author/Robin_Gibb_/3/" title="Robin Gibb Quotes">[4]</a>

## Staying alive in politics

Gibb was rather vocal and brash about his political views. Firstly, he was a staunch Israel supporter, even when much of the world community was calling for an Israel boycott due to their handling of the Palestine situation, Gibb went over and performed anyway.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.debbieschlussel.com/49849/robin-gibb-friend-of-israel-rip-23-bee-gees-gone/" title="Robin Gibb, Friend of Israel, RIP, 2/3rds of Bee Gees Gone">[5]</a>

In his homeland, Gibb was a major supporter of the Labour Party and their former leader, Tony Blair. Gibb accompanied Blair at Labour Party rallies in 2005<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2012/05/21/tributes-paid-after-bee-gees-star-robin-gibb-loses-cancer-fight-91466-31012641/#ixzz1vVtHgLXW" title="Tributes paid after Bee Gees star Robin Gibb loses cancer fight">[6]</a> and the duo endured criticism when Blair stayed at Gibb's Miami home while vacationing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6213401.stm" title="PM &apos;paying&apos; for Bee Gee home stay">[7]</a>

After his death, Blair said of him:

>Robin was not only an exceptional and extraordinary musician and songwriter, he was a highly intelligent, interested and committed human being. He was a great friend with a wonderful open and fertile mind and a student of history and politics.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.click-manchester.com/news/national-news/1216342-robin-gibb-tributes-for-the-late-bee-gee-flood-in.html" title="Robin Gibb: Tributes for the late Bee Gee flood in">[8]</a>
