Alessandra Ambrosio was born and raised in Erechim, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.

Several websites list Ambrosio's religion as Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.whosdatedwho.com/sections/celebrities/religion/roman-catholic_2" title="Celebrity Religion – Roman Catholic (Celebrities) (Page 2).">[1]</a> and that's certainly a good bet since about three-quarters of Brazilians consider themselves Roman Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.brazil.org.za/religion.html#.UM-9um_Adf0" title="Brazil Religion.">[2]</a>

I never found any other indication from the model that she's particularly devout–no God Tweets or church photos–except one picture of her wearing a pendant cross around her neck.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.stylebistro.com/lookbook/Alessandra+Ambrosio/u4rndVYIV8t/Pendant+Necklaces/angle/8OUEHvhVQu5" title="More Angles of Alessandra Ambrosio Cross Pendant.">[3]</a> And if one's entrance into heaven were judged by the weight of one's Jesus bling, I'd say she's got a pretty good shot.

So it's not much, but I'd say it's enough to call her a Catholic until one of you readers proves me wrong in the comments.

I have even less to say about her politics. If you consider her position as ambassador for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society even remotely political, then I guess there's that. She joined the cause after her own father was diagnosed with the disease and has appeared in several Public Service Announcement promoting awareness of the disease and raising funds to find a cure.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JVLDa-Zl3No" title="Alessandra Ambrosio – Bike MS – National MS Society.">[4]</a>

She doesn't appear to be interested in partisan politics either in her home country nor anywhere else. She's not particularly active in environmental causes or social causes or anything other typical celebrity cause. So again, until further notice, we'll go ahead and slap this article with a big non-political label.
