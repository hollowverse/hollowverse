Amber Rose, whose real name is Amber Levonchuck, was born and raised in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

Rose's father is of Irish and Italian descent,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.vh1.com/shows/big_morning_buzz_live/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=15414#moreinfo" title="Amber Rose">[1]</a> so we might safely assume that she has some sort of Catholic heritage. She has designated herself as a Christian, though no denomination was named.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithgoespop/2011/11/fgp-celebrity-quote-of-the-week-amber-rose-says-she-doesnt-smoke-pot-because-shes-christian/" title="FGP Celebrity Quote of the Week: Amber Rose Says She Doesn&apos;t Smoke Pot Because She&apos;s A Christian">[2]</a> The topic came up during an interview when Rose was speaking about her live-in boyfriend, rapper Wiz Khalifa. Wiz is an outspoken pothead, and Rose says she doesn't join him in his drug use because she's a Christian.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithgoespop/2011/11/fgp-celebrity-quote-of-the-week-amber-rose-says-she-doesnt-smoke-pot-because-shes-christian/" title="FGP Celebrity Quote of the Week: Amber Rose Says She Doesn&apos;t Smoke Pot Because She&apos;s A Christian">[3]</a>

Rose does occasionally say vaguely Christian things. For example, when she was donating some of her clothing to a charitable cause, she said:

>I've been blessed & the clothes I'm auctioning off are from my past now I'm moving on to my future & helping people at the same time. God is Good.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.searchquotes.com/quotes/author/Amber_Rose/" title="Amber Rose Quotes">[4]</a>

And during a particularly trying time in her life (unspecified), she said:

>Life is hard even when you're blessed but God will never give you more than you can handle.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.searchquotes.com/quotes/author/Amber_Rose/" title="Amber Rose Quotes">[5]</a>

## Politics is just rosy.

Rose is a Democrat–or at least she is when it comes to Obama. She was an outspoken supporter during the 2012 elections. On election day (November 6), Rose tweeted a series of hashtags–presumably as she was about to go vote:

>#TeamAmberRose4Obama #Rosebuds #RoseStuds #VoteObama #Forward2012 :-)<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/DaRealAmberRose" title="Amber Rose (DaRealAmberRose) on Twitter">[6]</a>

After the POTUS won a second term, Rose tweeted:

>Obama Won!!!! Yay! I'm gonna get so wasted tonight! Lol just kidding ;-) #4MoreYears goodnight my Loves xoxo :-)<a class="source-citation" href="#http://globalgrind.com/entertainment/amber-rose-getting-wasted-obama-instagram-pic-photos" title="Amber Rose Says She&apos;s Getting Wasted For Obama">[7]</a>

It was a bit of a joke, though, as Rose was pregnant at the time. She must have had a backlash because it's not on her Twitter feed anymore.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/DaRealAmberRose" title="Amber Rose (DaRealAmberRose) on Twitter">[8]</a>

Beyond that, Rose is a vocal supporter of GLBT causes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.vh1.com/shows/big_morning_buzz_live/cast_member.jhtml?personalityId=15414#moreinfo" title="Amber Rose">[9]</a> She once said (however unoriginal it might have been):

>Homosexuality is found in over 450 species. Homophobia is found in only 1. Which one seems unnatural now?<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.searchquotes.com/quotes/author/Amber_Rose/" title="Amber Rose Quotes">[10]</a>

Her baby's daddy, Wiz Khalifa, is quite politically outspoken about the legalization of marijuana. As previously mentioned, Rose isn't in to it–but she is at least tolerant of his pot smoking, even publiclly talking about how Wiz and her mother regularly get together and smoke up.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://hotspotatl.com/2623762/amber-rose-on-her-mom-smoking-weed-with-wiz-khalifa-wiz-is-like-the-son-she-never-had-exclusive/" title="Amber Rose On Her Mom Smoking Weed With Wiz Khalifa: &apos;Wiz Is Like The Son She Never Had.&apos;">[11]</a> It all amounts to a decidedly liberal lifestyle.
