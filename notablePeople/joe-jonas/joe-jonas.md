Joe Jonas was born in Casa Grande, Arizona and grew up in Wycoff, New Jersey.

Jonas and his two equally-famous brothers, Nick and Kevin, were raised Evangelical Christians. Their father, Nick Sr., was a pastor at the Wycoff Assemblies of God Church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farchive%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20204099%2C00.html" title="Growing Up Jonas">[1]</a>

Joe's faith is clearly important to him and permeates his personal and professional life. Asked to comment on the intersection of Christianity and rock 'n roll, Joe said:

>Even songs we write today, if you really listen to the lyrics, it can be about love songs, but it's also about our relationship with God. It's simple. We're Christian guys in a rock 'n' roll band.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beliefnet.com%2FEntertainment%2FMusic%2F2008%2F11%2FJonas-Brothers.aspx%3Fp%3D2" title="The Jonas Brothers on Faith">[2]</a>

At the beginning of their career, the Jonas Brothers' "purity rings" were highly scrutinized and, as is the tradition in their church, they pledged to stay virgins until they were married.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beliefnet.com%2FEntertainment%2FMusic%2F2008%2F11%2FJonas-Brothers.aspx%3Fp%3D4" title="The Jonas Brothers on Faith">[3]</a> However, Joe was criticized by fans and paparazzi after being spotted without his purity ring with his serious girlfriend, Ashley Greene.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.showbizspy.com%2Farticle%2F212415%2Fjoe-jonas-ditches-his-purity-ring-and-shacks-up-with-ashley-greene.html" title="Joe Jonas Ditches Purity Ring and Shacks Up With Ashley Greene">[4]</a>

But amidst the criticism, Joe has stayed strong in his faith. He has often expressed gratitude to God for his success and seems to particularly enjoy Bible study and group prayers during Jonas Brothers tours.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DU-89Kyf13qk%26feature%3Drelated" title="Jonas Brothers Talks about Their Church!">[5]</a>

## Brotherly politics

Joe Jonas will not discuss his political views.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FAre_the_Jonas_Brothers_republican" title="Are the Jonas Brothers Republican?">[6]</a> But those who speculate tend to lean toward saying that Joe and his brothers are Republicans.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhat_are_Joe_Jonas_political_views" title="What are Joe Jonas political views">[7]</a>

That would sort of conflict with their buddy-buddy relationship with the Obamas. It's no secret that Obama's daughters are huge fans of the Jonas Brothers and the two families have met on more than one occasion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2Fblogs%2Fpolitics%2F2009%2F01%2Fjonas-brothers%2F" title="Jonas Brothers Surprise First Tweens with White House Visit">[8]</a> The president even joked once that if the Jonas Brothers got cute with his daughters, he wasn't above sending predator drones after them.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fthe-scene%2Fevents%2FObama-Vs-The-Jonas-Brothers-92661779.html" title="Obama vs. the Jonas Brothers">[9]</a>

But none of this means anything in respect to Joe's personal political views, which still remain a mystery. The most political thing he's ever done is to promote voter registration and encourage people to get out and vote.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ecorazzi.com%2F2008%2F09%2F12%2Fthe-jonas-brothers-get-political-with-ellen-degeneres-and-declare-yourself%2F" title="The Jonas Brothers Get Political With Ellen DeGeneres And Declare Yourself">[10]</a>
