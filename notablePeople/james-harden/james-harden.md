James Harden was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up mostly in Compton, California.

Harden is a Christian, but what denomination remains a mystery. Some speculate that he's Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.askkids.com/BlackHistoryFAQ/James_Harden.html" title="James Harden FAQ.">[1]</a> but I see no reason to believe that. If any of you readers know something, give us a holler in the comments.

What we do know, however, is that he's a pretty devout dude. He tweets quite a bit about God and his religion, stating one Sunday how pleased he was to go to church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://tweetwood.com/JHarden13/tweet/260089282755194881" title="James Harden tweets.">[2]</a> And when asked to make a shockingly quick decision on whether or not to accept an offer to sign with a different team, he confessed in one interview that he wished he had had time to go home and pray about it.<a class="source-citation" href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/james-harden-wanted-time-to-pray-before-leaving-okc-84599/cpt" title="James Harden Wanted Time to Pray Before Leaving OKC.">[3]</a>

He also wears a bracelet during games that states: In Jesus' Name I Play,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christculturenews.com/james-harden-wears-in-jesus-name-i-play-active-faith-wristbands/" title="James Harden Wears &apos;In Jesus Name I Play&apos; Active Faith Wristbands.">[4]</a> and after making an impressive record-setting debut for the Houston Rockets in 2013, he tweeted,

>I just want to thank God for everything he has done in my life. I really am a believer. All glory to the man above.<a class="source-citation" href="http://global.christianpost.com/news/james-harden-wanted-time-to-pray-before-leaving-okc-84599/cpt" title="James Harden Wanted Time to Pray Before Leaving OKC.">[5]</a>

It all adds up to James Harden, the devout Christian.


## If Patriotism is Political. . .

Harden doesn't have a lick to say about politics. Not one word about Obama, guns, gay people, taxes, or anything else. Nothing. The only thing I can even begin to point to is the fact that he appears to be a patriotic guy. He tweeted a picture of the airplane that hit the South Tower of the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001 with the caption:

>I will never forget. 9/11<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/PctCSmNlX3/" title="Photo by jharden13.">[6]</a>

And, on a lighter note, he was pretty stoked for his country when his basketball team took the gold at the London Olympics in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/OPIx7vNlUV/" title="Photo by jharden13.">[7]</a>

But beyond that, there's really nothing. It's safe to assume for now that James Harden is utterly non-political. If you know anything that can prove me wrong, please let us know in the comments.
