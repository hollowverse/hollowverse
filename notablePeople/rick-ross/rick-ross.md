Rick Ross, whose real name is William Leonard Roberts II, was born in Coahoma County, Mississippi and grew up outside of Miami, Florida in Carol City, Miami.

While some speculate that, because of his beard, Ross is a Muslim. This isn't the case. Ross is a Christian, albeit a controversial Christian. He isn't shy about discussing his religious views, even on Christian television shows where he says things like:

>If you consider yourself real, or you think you're making real rap, you've got to talk about God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rapbasement.com/videos/49967/Rick-Ross-Interview-On-A-Christian-TV-Show.html" title="Rick Ross – Interview On A Christian TV Show Video">[1]</a>

Ross goes on to say that God is the reason for his success and admits that he says a prayer before every performance.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rapbasement.com/videos/49967/Rick-Ross-Interview-On-A-Christian-TV-Show.html" title="Rick Ross – Interview On A Christian TV Show Video">[2]</a>

However, as his critics are quick to point out, the content of his rap and the lifestyle Ross seems to promote are rather anti-Christian. For example, his song "Holy Ghost" features Ross asking the Chrisitian demi-deity for help in making a successful drug deal happen and, rather than money being the root of all evil, Ross raps that "being broke" is the root of all evil.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.christianpost.com/news/secular-rapper-makes-degrading-song-about-the-holy-ghost-67375/" title="Secular Rapper Offends With Song About the Holy Ghost">[3]</a>

Beyond that, Ross has talked about his involvement in Florida cocaine cartels and big smuggling business,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1623625/bio" title="Rick Ross (III) – Biography">[4]</a> but it turns out that Ross was actually on the good side of the law as a correctional officer, even though he vehemently tried to deny it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.7356/title.rick-ross-exposed-by-thesmokinggun-com" title="Rick Ross Exposed By Thesmokinggun.com">[5]</a>

All tolled, this throws into question Ross' persona as hard, and maybe as Christian. Who knows who he really is?


## From one hustler to another

Ross isn't a political rapper like, say, Kid Cudi or Mos Def. He likes to rap about the usual—hos and drugs and whatnot. He doesn't seem to get into politics, but he has effectively said he likes Obama–but one wonders if it's a case of one hustler acknowledging another or maybe just a race thing. Ross said:

>Shout out to Obama! You're a politician, you want to roll… There's nothing wrong with that. You still get my vote.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EJ8c-iEd0Bw" title="Rick Ross Endorses Obama, Loves Clemens on VBS.tv">[6]</a>

It's difficult to know what that means, except for the "you still get my vote part," but it's an endorsement nonetheless.
