Julianne Hough was born and raised in Sandy, Utah.

Hough grew up in the Mormon church and still considers herself a Mormon, although she "may not be as active in it as some people are."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.gossiprocks.com/forum/latest-gossip/189346-julianne-hough-talks-growing-up-mormon-interview-magazine.html" title="Julianne Hough Talks Growing Up Mormon with Interview Magazine.">[1]</a> She said while growing up, the rules were pretty strict, and even though at last check she was saving her virginity for the perfect man, she's loosened up a bit. Describing her childhood she said,

>No sex before marriage, no drinking alcohol, no drugs, no dating before you are 16, pornography is not good. . . . I still try to be a good person — yeah, I like a glass of wine with dinner and I don't think there is anything wrong with that.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebitchy.com/233528/julianne_hough_on_her_virginity_fear_of_dating_powerful_ryan_seacrest/" title="Julianne Hough on her virginity &amp; fear of dating &quot;powerful&quot; Ryan Seacrest.">[2]</a>

But her faith is clearly still very important to her, and she has good things to say about her upbringing:

>The thing that I loved about growing up Mormon is that I had morals and standards instilled in me as a kid—like, you need to be a nice person, and a thoughtful person. . .<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.gossiprocks.com/forum/latest-gossip/189346-julianne-hough-talks-growing-up-mormon-interview-magazine.html" title="Julianne Hough Talks Growing Up Mormon with Interview Magazine.">[3]</a>

It could be hard trying to be a good Mormon girl in Hollywood, but despite her glass of wine with dinner, she seems to be pulling it off. It's not like she exactly fits into the celebrity cliche, though. After all, she's not even a Democrat.


## Grand Old Family Politics

Hough's father Bruce, with whom she is very close, is a prominent Utah Republican politician,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705296704/Country-singers-roots-are-in-Utah.html?pg=1" title="Country singer&apos;s roots are in Utah.">[4]</a> so is appears that alongside her Mormon upbringing were lessons in Grand Old Party politics. And she reportedly supported Mitt Romney during the 2012 presidential race, which doesn't come as too much of a shock.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.wetpaint.com/dancing-with-the-stars/articles/dancing-with-the-gop-julianne-hough-supports-mitt-romney-" title="Dancing With The GOP: Julianne Hough Supports Mitt Romney.">[5]</a>

Despite her political family and her admission that she was following closely the Republican presidential nomination race in 2012,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.wetpaint.com/dancing-with-the-stars/articles/dancing-with-the-gop-julianne-hough-supports-mitt-romney-" title="Dancing With The GOP: Julianne Hough Supports Mitt Romney.">[6]</a> Hough doesn't talk about politics in public all that much. I couldn't find anything about her positions on health care, immigration, taxes, or even Obama. Whether it's because the topic isn't terribly important to her or that she doesn't care to talk about it, it seems that Hough is at least a little connected to the world of politics.
