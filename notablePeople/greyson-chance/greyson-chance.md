Greyson Chance was born in Wichita Falls, Texas. He grew up mostly in Edmond, Oklahoma.

Chance is definitely a Christian, and although some speculate that he's Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="http://vitanovato.blogspot.com/2012/03/100-facts-about-greyson.html" title="100 Facts About Greyson.">[1]</a> I couldn't confirm that. Regardless, his devotion to God is written all over his Twitter and Instagram feeds.

To name only a few, next to a picture of a ski lift he posted on Instagram, Chance wrote, "Skiing in God's country."<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/UCujpxs1Un/" title="Photo by greysonchance.">[2]</a> And after posting that he would be performing on T.V. on New Year's Eve, he mentioned that he was honored to know Dick Clark would be watching him from heaven.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/greysonchance/status/278966144566702080" title="greysonchance: Plus I am so honored to be …">[3]</a> He also kept in mind the whole Jesus thing during Christmas. He posted a manger scene on Instagram with the caption,

>"For to us a child is born. And he shall be called Prince of Peace."<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/Tpp8RjM1cp/" title="Photo by greysonchance.">[4]</a>

So it appears that he's a fairly religious young man. Maybe his faith will keep him grounded after his early rise to fame.


## Budding Liberal

Despite the fact that, as of the writing of this article, Chance isn't even old enough to vote, we have a pretty good idea of what party he'll be voting for when he turns 18: the Democrats.

On election day in 2012, along with some Obama retweets,<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/greysonchance" title="Greyson Chance (greysonchance) on Twitter.">[5]</a> he posted a photo of Obama with the caption,

>Even though I am on the other side of the world, I am proud to be an American.<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/Rt_cHqs1SD/" title="Photo by greysonchance">[6]</a>

He also appears to support LGBT rights. He performed at a Human Rights Campaign event in 2011 that honored New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg's efforts to make gay marriage legal in his state.<a class="source-citation" href="http://greysonchanceuniverse.blogspot.com/2011/10/greyson-chance-supporting-lesbian-gay.html" title="Greyson Chance Supporting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Civil Rights with D.C. Show Tonight.">[7]</a> And he recorded a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h3UP02vQ_8) for Lady Gaga's Born This Way Foundation, which aims to empower young people against bullying.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h3UP02vQ_8" title="Greyson Chance records a PSA for Born This Way Foundation and Office Depot!">[8]</a>

It's also possible that he's a pacifist since he posted [this](http://instagram.com/p/TjlekGs1aZ/) picture of a stop sign with the word "war" written on the bottom, making it read "Stop War."<a class="source-citation" href="http://instagram.com/p/TjlekGs1aZ/" title="Photo by greysonchance.">[9]</a> But that might be taking things a little far–most likely he's an idealist young man.

As Greyson grows up, keep us updated in the comments!
