Shania Twain, whose given name is Eilleen Regina Edwards, was born in Windsor, Ontario and raised in Timmons, Ontario, with a brief stint in Toronto.

Twain grew up Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.annointed.net/Community/prayer-salvation-someone-you-love/36524-shania-twain-who-practices-relgion-called-sant-mat.html" title="For Shania Twain who practices a religion called Sant Mat.">[1]</a> but practiced a syncretic eastern philosophy called Sant Mat with her first husband.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,386726,00.html" title="Shania&apos;s Secret Side.">[2]</a> The philosophy emphasizes meditation, yoga, non-violence, and eating a vegetarian diet–among other things.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Contemporary_Sant_Mat_movements" title="Contemporary Sant Mat movements.">[3]</a>

She kept her life very private during this time, so we don't know a whole lot about her spiritual practices. We know she's a vegetarian<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allamericanspeakers.com/Celebrity_Vegetarians.php" title="Celebrity Vegetarians and Vegans.">[4]</a> and that she practices yoga,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.babble.com/cs/famecrawler/2008/12/07/shania-twain-s-5-step-recovery-after-cheating-spouse-breaks-her-heart/" title="Shania Twain&apos;s 5 Steps Recovery After Cheating Spouse Breaks Her Heart.">[5]</a> but that's about it. Regardless of the details, she's obviously a spiritual person:

>I'm always soul searching on a spiritual level. That's a permanent occupation of mine, I think, for the rest of my life.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1560540/cmt-insider-interview-shania-twain.jhtml" title="CMT Insider Interview: Shania Twain.">[6]</a>

But Twain's been pretty pissed ever since her husband left her for her best friend, so there's at least a decent chance she ditched the philosophy with the man.


## Politics for the non-political

Twain says she's not a political person, or at least she's tolerant of other viewpoints and wants to keep hers to herself:

>I'm not the politician, and I just completely remove myself from that. I don't have anything against or for any particular person or point of view on politics. I have my own opinions, but my songs don't share them.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.cmt.com/news/country-music/1560540/cmt-insider-interview-shania-twain.jhtml" title="CMT Insider Interview: Shania Twain.">[7]</a>

That didn't stop both Hillary Clinton and Al Gore from using her song, "Rock This Country!" during their campaigns.<a class="source-citation" href="http://politicaltunes.wordpress.com/2012/05/10/shania-twain-rock-this-country/" title="Shania Twain – Rock This Country!">[8]</a> I guess they didn't care that she's a Canadian who lives in Switzerland.

Twain hasn't come out for or against hot political issues like gay marriage, but she did get a shout-out from PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) for being one of their "Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrities."<a class="source-citation" href="http://features.peta.org/sexiest-vegetarian-celebrities-2012/#Female" title="PETA&apos;s Sexiest Vegetarian Celebrities of 2012.">[9]</a>
