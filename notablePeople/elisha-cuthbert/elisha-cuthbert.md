Elisha Cuthbert was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada and was raised in Greenfield Park, Quebec, Canada.

Usually I can find a little tidbit, an anecdote, or a piece of speculation about just about every single celebrity. Cuthbert, however, did not make it easy.

Literally, the only thing I could find on this actress was [this picture](http://areminder.tumblr.com/post/34282895666/teamcoco-elisha-cuthbert-says-a-little-prayer), which is probably her. For those of you who are too lazy to click on the link, it's a picture of (probably) her holding her hands together as if in prayer and with her eyes closed.

So. . . let's just say our conclusions are inconclusive. We'll call her non-religious until further notice.

Her political views are equally totally ambiguous. Seriously. The only thing I could find about politics, either in Canada where she's from, or the United States where she lives and works, was that her ex-boyfriend supports gay marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jdoasis.com%2Fblog%2Fstanding-support-same-sex-marriage" title="Standing In Support of Same-Sex Marriage.">[1]</a> I'm telling you, it's rough out there.

The fact that she's a Hollywood actress automatically raises the liberal flag, although politics by association is always sketchy business. But maybe the fact that she associates with known social liberals can help strengthen our assumption?

It seems that Cuthbert is pretty good at keeping her opinions to herself. Or she just doesn't have any. Either way, non-political it is! If any of you fans can help us out with some reliable information, let us know in the comments.
