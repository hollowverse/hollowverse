Fergie, whose real name is Stacy Ann Ferguson, was born and raised in Hacienda Heights, California.

Fergie was brought up a devout Catholic. But as a teenager and young woman, Fergie faced a hard battle with methamphetamine.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2012/06/fergie-good-catholic-girl/" title="Fergie: good Catholic girl">[1]</a> Now, the singer seems to have come full-circle and rejoined the flock. Fergie credits God for helping her kick her habit, saying:

>I had a conversation with God, basically. I don't know how to interpret this, but he said, 'I've given you this beautiful gift (singing) and you're throwing it away.'<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/god-+-peas-saved-fergie-from-homeless-druggie-hell_24_02_2006" title="Black Eyed Peas – God + Peas Saved Fergie From Homeless Druggie Hell">[2]</a>

Now she lists going to church as one of her favorite activities, saying:

>On Saturday nights, we [she and husband Josh Duhamel] like going to mass, then dinner. It feeds our spiritual side, and it's great to hear Josh sing in church – he's a great singer. Then we go out and have a really nice wine, like all good Catholics.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/deaconsbench/2012/06/fergie-good-catholic-girl/" title="Fergie: good Catholic girl">[3]</a>

Furthermore, she and Duhamel were married in a Catholic ceremony.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.elle.com/pop-culture/reviews/fergie-josh-286269" title="Fergie and Josh Wedding Photos">[4]</a>

But judging from Fergie's on-stage performances, one would have to conclude that she's one of those "open-to-gratuitous-exhibitionism" Catholics.


## Black Eyed Politics

Politically, Fergie comes off pretty liberal. She's certainly a Democrat, having actively supported Obama in 2008. She even called his nomination acceptance speech "amazing" and "excellent."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nme.com/news/nme/39387" title="Fergie on Obama&apos;s speech: &apos;It was amazing.&apos;">[5]</a> Fergie has been a regular at the White House since good 'ol Obama took office. She gave a private concert to Obama's daughters<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.popcrunch.com/fergie-white-house-concert-for-obama-girls/" title="Fergie White House Concert For Obama Girls">[6]</a> and performed at the White House Easter Egg Hunt. Though, that performance didn't go over too well and some parents complained, particularly after Fergie, while dressed in less-than-modest attire, sang:

>If you ain't got no money take your broke ass home.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ihatethemedia.com/fergie-performance-horrifies-parents-at-white-house-easter-egg-hunt" title="Fergie&apos;s performance horrifies parents at Obama White House Easter Egg Hunt">[7]</a>

Fergie does have a bit of a political agenda. She sang Obama's praises in 2010, with one caveat, saying:

>I think Barack Obama definitely gave a different perspective of America on other countries and I think in terms of foreign relations he's really helped us and the way people think about America. But I wish he would do more for gay marriages, though. That's the one thing I want to happen!<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thefabfemme.com/?p=7479" title="Fergie talks gay marriage">[8]</a>

Obviously, this was before Obama became the first president to explicitly endorse gay marriage, subsequently causing the end of the world for millions of religious conservatives.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/post/obama-comes-out-for-same-sex-marriage-world-ends/2012/05/09/gIQAy60iDU_blog.html" title="Obama comes out for same-sex marriage, world ends">[9]</a> Now, Fergie must just think Obama's the greatest thing since meth.
