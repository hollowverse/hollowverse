Sean Combs, also known as P. Diddy, Puff Daddy or Diddy, was born in Harlem, New York City and raised in Mount Vernon, New York.

Combs is a Christian. He was brought up going to a Catholic school in the Bronx, New York called Mount St. Michael.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/old-news-old-school-article-1.898411" title="He&apos;s Old News At His Old School">[1]</a> We're not sure if he still calls himself Catholic or what denomination he would claim allegiance to–it's not something he talks about much–but Christianity is definitely his thing.

Combs appeared on Bill Maher's television show to speak about his support of Barack Obama. But when the conversation turned to the fact that many people might want to assassinate the president, Combs said he felt secure that God was watching over him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhAcMd75TheskUTHdf" title="Video: P. Diddy Interview On Real Time With Bill Maher">[2]</a>

Maher, being the anti-religious atheist that he is, pursued the topic of Combs' faith, at which point, Combs said:

>[I owe it] all to God, all to Jesus, yes sir… God is good all the time.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhAcMd75TheskUTHdf" title="Video: P. Diddy Interview On Real Time With Bill Maher">[3]</a>

The only other reference to God Combs has made that I can find came in reference to Obama–causing me to wonder if he believes in the divine right of kings or something. Combs said:

>[Obama is] the person that we believed in so I pray night and day that he understands how God ordained his presidency. I feel there was a promise made to God to look after people that was less fortunate, and [many] of those people are African-American…<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sandrarose.com/2011/01/sean-combs-do-better-obama/" title="Sean Combs: &quot;Do Better, Obama.&quot;">[4]</a>

But other than that, Combs seems too busy tending to his hip hop empire to get all religious.


## Making friends on all sides of the aisle

It's probably obvious that Combs is an Obama fan. It's true. He hosted fundraisers and attended fancy events in 2008 and 2012 to help Obama get elected.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhAcMd75TheskUTHdf" title="Video: P. Diddy Interview On Real Time With Bill Maher">[5]</a>

But he's not all glowing endorsements. In 2011, when asked what he thought of Obama's job thus far, he replied:

>I love the president like most of us. I just want the president to do better.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sandrarose.com/2011/01/sean-combs-do-better-obama/" title="Sean Combs: &quot;Do Better, Obama.&quot;">[6]</a>

But does all this Obama stuff make him a Democrat? Not necessarily. When interviewed by conservative Fox New pundit, Bill O'Reilly, Combs said he was an Independent:

>Yes, but I don't want to be a Republican or a Democrat… I want to be an Independent. To me, it's not about the party. It's not voting the party. It's about voting for the best person.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://mediamatters.org/research/2004/09/03/oreilly-to-p-diddy-you-should-be-a-republican/131807" title="O&apos;Reilly to P. Diddy: &quot;You Should Be A Republican.&quot;">[7]</a>

O'Reilly went on to point out that Combs had turned himself into a millionaire–so he naturally fits more into the Republican mold (that could be disputed, I know) but Combs wasn't having it. He said:

>Yes. But at the same time, there are some people out there that need help.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://mediamatters.org/research/2004/09/03/oreilly-to-p-diddy-you-should-be-a-republican/131807" title="O&apos;Reilly to P. Diddy: &quot;You Should Be A Republican.&quot;">[8]</a>

As anyone who follows the exploits of Sean Combs, you know he can be so diplomatic.
