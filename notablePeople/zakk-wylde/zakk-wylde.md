Zakk Wylde was born in Bayonne, New Jersey and grew up in Jackson, New Jersey.

Wylde is of Irish descent<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0943711/bio" title="Zakk Wylde – Biography">[1]</a> so naturally, he's a Catholic.

It's a bit difficult to imagine a heavy metal rocker of Wylde's caliber being religious–unless it's Satanism or something–but the truth is, Wylde is quite devout. He even takes time to give some of his true-blue Satanist comrades a hard time, particularly Kerry King of Slayer.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/interviews/black_label_society_no_new_studio_album_until_2014.html" title="Black Label Society: No New Studio Album Until 2014">[2]</a>

It seems that Wylde attends church regularly, even when on tour. Once, a journalist caught him on some random day and asked him about his religious views. Wylde responded:

>I just went to Mass yesterday. If we're on the road and I see a church, I'll just go in there and say some prayers.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/487416/zakk-wylde-it-would-be-an-honor-to-play-with-pantera" title="Zakk Wylde: &apos;It Would Be An Honor&apos; To Play With Pantera">[3]</a>

And Wylde seems to think his career in the spotlight is some kind of mandate from God. He said:

>I'm a soldier of Christ, man. Without a doubt. The bottom line is that He's with me all the time.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theaureview.com/interviews/the-au-interview-zakk-wylde-of-black-label-society-los-angeles-ca" title="Zakk Wylde of Black Label Society">[4]</a>

I would have rather he said he was shredding for Jesus, or melting faces for Christ, but that'll do.


## Metal and War

Wylde hasn't explicitly come out with any political preference–at least in terms of parties or candidates. But he is widely considered to be a Republican, or at least in sync with Republican ideals.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.avclub.com/artists/black-label-society,32303/" title="Black Label Society">[5]</a>

The only reason I can find that might suggest that this is true is his views on the Iraq War and President George W. Bush. Once, at a concert, Wylde said to the crowd:

>[The enemy is] down with the Devil, well that's great because we are down with God, and we will kick your ass!<a class="source-citation" href="http://thegreyfalcon.wordpress.com/2010/03/07/zakk-wylde-is-one-man-is-the-music-business-that-loves-america/" title="Zakk Wylde is One Man in the Music Business That Loves America">[6]</a>

And in the early 2000's, when some artists were catching criticism for speaking out against the war and Bush, Wylde tossed in his two cents:

>I mean, you don't talk out against our government. I can't stand these fuckers that complain about our government. I mean, if you don't like it so much, move the fuck out… You don't speak out against our president during a time of war. You just don't do that.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=11848" title="Zakk Wylde: No American Should Speak Out Against Our President During A Time of War">[7]</a>

That's cool, we'll just scrap the First Amendment. Who needs it anyway?

So, put it all together, you've got a pro-Iraq War Catholic, connecting the enemy to the Devil and U.S. forces to God. Plus, he doesn't like that people would protest war or government policy. Sounds pretty religious right-wing to me. What do y'all think?
