Tom Felton was born and raised in Epsom, Surrey, England.

Felton sang in his church choir when he was a kid, and eventually was asked to join the Guildford Cathedral Choir.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0271657/bio" title="Tom Felton – Biography.">[1]</a> Considering the cathedral is affiliated with the Church of England, coupled with the fact that he's an English lad, I would assume he was at least raised in the Anglican tradition.

But he doesn't appear to be too devout anymore. He doesn't talk about God in interviews and he doesn't send out prayers on his [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/TomFelton). He's at least Christian enough to feel "Christmassy"<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/TomFelton/status/281193811999330305" title="TomFelton: Im feeling very Christmassy!!!">[2]</a> around the holidays, but that's about the extent of it. If you have any more information for us, let us know in the comments.

There's no ambiguity about his politics though: he's totally uninvolved. He described himself as not particularly patriotic in one interview where he complained about English food and called the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebration an inconvenience.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://feltbeats.com/2009/12/12/tom-felton-discusses-fantasy-fishing-his-patriotism-or-lack-therof-and-chocolate-pancakes-with-dave-darren-from-kbob-radio/" title="Tom Felton discusses fantasy fishing, his patriotism (or lack thereof), and chocolate pancakes with Dave &amp; Darren from KBOB radio.">[3]</a> He, not surprisingly, doesn't have anything to say about any political parties or politicians either.

He is an avid carp fisherman,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://teacher.scholastic.com/scholasticnews/indepth/harry_potter_movie/interviews/index.asp?article=tom_felton&topic=1" title="Tom Felton Talks About Reading, Collecting, and Being Draco.">[4]</a> so maybe he's got some latent environmentalism in there, but he doesn't let on about it. So, completely non-political it is for Mr. Felton.
