Paul Walker was born in Glendale, California and grew up in San Fernando Valley.

Walker was brought up in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or Mormons, in a large family of five children. Some of the more visible aspects of that faith include abstaining from sex before marriage and abstaining from drugs and alcohol. Apparently, Walker no longer follows these guidelines, however, as he says:

>I still hold myself accountable. I'm not the kind of guy who's taking advantage of my position. I could be sleeping with a different 18-year-old girl every day if I wanted to. But that's not my speed.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Flife%2Fpeople%2F2005-09-27-paul-walker_x.htm" title="Fame lets Paul Walker dive in">[1]</a>

In fact, Walker doesn't consider himself a Mormon anymore<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beliefnet.com%2FEntertainment%2FGalleries%2FSurprisingly-Religious-Movie-and-TV-Stars.aspx%3Fp%3D2" title="Surprisingly Religious Movie and TV Stars">[2]</a> but he's still quite religious–in a non-denominational, Christian sort of way. And he simply doesn't get atheism:

>I'm a Christian now. The things that drove me crazy growing up was how everyone works at fault-finding with different religions. The people I don't understand are atheists. I go surfing and snow boarding and I'm always around nature. I look at everything and think, 'Who couldn't believe there's a God? Is all this a mistake?' It just blows me away.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0908094%2Fbio" title="Paul Walker (I) – Biography">[3]</a>

Those religious roots don't go away easy.


## Self-proclaimed political contradiction

Walker easily falls into the non-political category. One gets the sense he's just doing his thing, with none too many cares. Originally, his dream was to be a marine biologist and one of his idols is Jacques Cousteau<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0908094%2Fbio" title="Paul Walker (I) – Biography">[4]</a> so one might assume he's  bit of an environmentalist.

Well, it's half true. He once said:

>I'm passionate about animals and I hunt too. It's like I save and I kill. I'm a walking, talking contradiction. I'm all about preserving the environment but I'm racing cars on the weekend. I tell everyone I'm a gun-loving hippy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0908094%2Fbio" title="Paul Walker (I) – Biography">[5]</a>

There you have it, folks: gun-loving hippy.

His only other political statement was a joke referring to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms scandal colloquially known as "Fast and Furious," (also the name of his hit movies…) in which the government agency hoped to entrap Mexican drug cartels by providing them with weapons (it's a long story, have a look [here](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ATF_gunwalking_scandal) if you're interested).

Anyway, during the height of the media circus around the scandal, Walker tweeted:

>Hey look, #fastandfurious is trending. #Itsnotwhatyouthink.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fblogs%2Fclick%2F2012%2F06%2Ftweet-of-the-day-paul-walker-126800.html" title="Tweet of the day: Paul Walker">[6]</a>

He's got jokes. But does he care about politics? Doesn't really seem like it.
