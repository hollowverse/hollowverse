David Guetta, whose real name is Pierre David Guetta, was born and raised in Paris, France.

Guetta's family is Morrocan Sephardi Jewish.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lyricsfreak.com/d/david+guetta/biography.html" title="David Guetta – Biography">[1]</a> It is unclear how devout Guetta is to Judaism now that he's an international electronic music superstar, but he's at least curious about other religions. While on tour in India, he said:

>How you people live, your religion and your habits, I really don't know much, and that's the reason I'm so curious about India.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-17/news-and-interviews/31204441_1_indian-fans-dj-huge-fan" title="I&apos;m hounoured touring India, says David Guetta">[2]</a>

There is some speculation that his song, "Without You" is religious in nature with lyrics like:

>I won't run, I won't fly/I will never make it by/Without you, without you/I can't rest, I can't fight/All I need is you and I/Without you, without…. You!<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.directlyrics.com/david-guetta-without-u-lyrics.html" title="David Guetta – Without You Lyrics">[3]</a>

But it could just as easily be about a girl, or his fans.


## Not Even French Politics

Guetta appears to be wholly non-political. I couldn't even find any political mentions on French websites. If I'm wrong, feel free to leave a comment or send an email to the site.

Normally, I would make conjectures, but as I am not familiar with French politics, I don't even feel comfortable doing that.
