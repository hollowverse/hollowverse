Soulja Boy was born in Chicago, Illinois and grew up in Atlanta, Georgia.

He hasn't said a word about his religious views or affiliations. He did freestyle rap a song called "Nu Religion," but it's nothing more than a long description of his experiences (made up experiences, presumably) shooting people.<a class="source-citation" href="http://rapgenius.com/Soulja-boy-nu-religion-freestyle-lyrics" title="Soulja Boy – Nu Religion freestyle">[1]</a>

Having grown up in the South, we can assume he was surrounded by Christianity. And the city of Atlanta has more Protestants than anything else.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atlanta#Demographics" title="Atlanta">[2]</a> So, protestant Christian, then?


## Anti-military Soulja

Soulja is an Obama supporter and he turned 18 in 2008 just before the elections. But his reasoning wasn't only race-related. Citing Obama's promise to end the Iraq War, he said:

>I'm pretty much going for Obama. [He's] got my vote. I'm starting to sweat it. The war is crazy right now. My auntie's over there, so we'd love to see them come back real soon.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1592118/soulja-boy-hell-be-voting-obama.jhtml" title="Soulja Boy Tell&apos;em Says He&apos;ll Be Casting His First Vote For Obama, Talks Bow Wow Mixtape">[3]</a>

We can assume he continued his support of the president into 2012 because in 2011, he released a song called "I Am Obama." The track is full of praise of the president.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gw7BgPaJU3E" title="Soulja Boy – I am Obama! *New 2011.*">[4]</a>

But continuing his anti-war concerns, Soulja Boy angered some in the establishment with the lyrics:

>Fuck the FBI and the army troops … fighting for what? Be your own man … I'll be flying through the clouds with green like I'm Peter Pan.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/09/06/soulja-boy-apologizes-after-members-armed-forces-slam-his-anti-military-song/#ixzz1XOWi2ZO3" title="Soulja Boy Apologizes After Memebers of Armed Forces Slam His Anti-Military Song">[5]</a>

After a swift backlash, Soulja released an eloquent aplology, the entirety of which can be found [here](http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/09/06/soulja-boy-apologizes-after-members-armed-forces-slam-his-anti-military-song/#ixzz1XOWi2ZO3). It's worth reading. The best part might be:

>As a young man who grew up in the post-9/11 era, I have watched our country fight two wars that seem like they are never going to end. I have seen thousands and thousands of our brave men and women get killed in battle and often times, I think for what? A lot of people in this country are struggling to make ends meet and I think a lot about what if we had never gone to war.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2011/09/06/soulja-boy-apologizes-after-members-armed-forces-slam-his-anti-military-song/#ixzz1XOWi2ZO3" title="Soulja Boy Apologizes After Memebers of Armed Forces Slam His Anti-Military Song">[6]</a>
