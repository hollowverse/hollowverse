Hugh Laurie, whose full name is James Hugh Calum Laurie, was born in Oxford, England.

Laurie was raised in a strict Presbyterian family.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hughlaurie.net/rollingstoneapr5/rollingstoneapr501.jpg" title="Dr. Feelbad">[1]</a> He has since confirmed repeatedly that he is an atheist. The following quote might have clues as to why he rejected religion and god:

>I don't believe in God, but I have this idea that if there were a God, or destiny of some kind looking down on us, that if he saw you taking anything for granted he'd take it away. So he'll be like: 'You think this is going pretty well?' Then he'll go and send down some big disaster.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/insider/man-about-the-house/story-e6frewt9-1111114738268" title="Man about the House">[2]</a>

My guess is that his devout upbringing instilled a sense of fear and guilt in Laurie and perhaps the doomsday prose of biblical books like Revelations caused Laurie to think: 'God sucks, I'm just not going to believe in Him.' But the guilt stuck. Laurie said:

>Yeah, guilt I can do. If I have any expertise at all, it's in the area of guilt. I have a black belt in it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hughlaurie.net/rollingstoneapr5/rollingstoneapr502.jpg" title="Dr. Feelbad 2">[3]</a>

Laurie's best friend, the best man at his wedding, and the godfather of his children is famous British intellectual and atheist, Stephen Fry.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2005/apr/24/comment.broadcasting" title="The Observer Profile: Hugh Laurie">[4]</a> Fry's condemnations of God and religion are much more eloquent and pointed than Laurie's, and have no doubt been an influence on Laurie.


## Gimpy politics

Laurie's politics favor the common man, labor, and the left. And he can be quite funny about it. Laurie is somewhat of an accomplished musician. He once sang a televised protest song with the lyrics: "the poor keep getting hungry, and the rich keep getting fat." The funny part was his solution. He would sing: "All we need to do isâ€¦" then mumble something unintelligible.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://front.moveon.org/hugh-laurie-house-sings-amazing-protest-song/" title="Hugh Laurie From &quot;House&quot; Sings An Amazing Protest Song">[5]</a> The point being, of course, that he doesn't know what to do about the world's problems, but at least he seems to care.

Perhaps Laurie's most pointed political statement was a commercial he did with Stephen Fry on behalf of the British Labour Party. The video portrayed Britain's wealthy tax-dodgers and the lawyers who find them tax loopholes as greedy, self-serving malcontents and promised that the Labour Party would close the loopholes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPJahn24w24" title="Stephen Fry and Hugh Laurie Labour Party Political Broadcast 25th November 1993">[6]</a>

So, despite being the world's highest-paid television actor,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/8762970/Guinness-Book-of-Records-Hugh-Laurie-is-most-watched-man-on-television.html" title="Guinness Book of World Records: High Laurie is most watched man on television">[7]</a> Laurie is apparently a champion for the regular guy and an enemy of the rich.
