Jenna Jameson, whose given name was Jenna Marie Massoli, was born in Las Vegas, Nevada and grew up in various places in the western U.S. including Arizona and Montana.

Jameson claims to be a devout Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://religionblog.dallasnews.com/2008/08/jenna-jameson-devout-catholic.html/" title="Jenna Jameson = &apos;Devout Catholic&apos; says Fox News">[1]</a> But her critics, and there are many, are quick to point out her promiscuity and the fact that she undoubtedly used birth control during her many sex scenes as well as the fact that she used in vitro fertilization to get pregnant.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jewishjournal.com/thegodblog/item/jenna_jameson_porn_queen_and_devout_catholic_20080826/#comments" title="Jenna Jameson, porn queen and &apos;devout Catholic.&apos;">[2]</a>

Still, Jameson keeps the faith, saying of her miscarriages and cancer:

>It was all in God's plan.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://icydk.com/2009/03/16/its-twin-boys-for-jenna-jameson/" title="It&apos;s twin boys for Jenna Jameson">[3]</a>

It's all about faith anyway. She can just do, like, a million Hail Mary's for the profiting on gratuitous sex and stuff. That's what confession is for!


## Sex and politics

Jameson is a bit nuanced when it comes to politics. In fact, when it comes to political agendas, she's refreshingly honest about the reason behind her political views. She started out as a liberal Democrat, even supporting People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) after learning of KFC's inhumane chicken-raising practices. She played-up her strengths for the organization, appearing in a PETA ad–in the nude.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://secure.peta.org/site/Advocacy?cmd=display&page=UserAction&id=2011" title="Jenna Jamesson&apos;s Nude PETA Ad Addresses the Issue of Too Much Sex">[4]</a>

Jameson endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2008 as well, citing the fact that she liked the idea of a woman in office, but also for the sake of the adult film industry. She said:

>The Clinton administration was the best years for the adult industry and I wish that Clinton would run again. I would love to have him back in office. I would love to have Al Gore in office. When Republicans are in office, the problem is, a lot of times they try to put their crosshairs on the adult industry, to make a point.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.pr.com/article/1066" title="Jenna Jameson – Portrait of a Mainstream Sex Icon">[5]</a>

There's gotta be a Monica Lewinsky joke in there somewhere…

She switched teams in 2012, though, and endorsed Mitt Romney for president. She realized that being rich and supporting Democrats was a bit of a paradox. She said:

>I'm very looking forward to a Republican being back in office. When you're rich, you want a Republican in office.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.wtsp.com/news/national/article/266612/81/Porn-star-endorses-Romney" title="Porn star Jenna Jameson endorses Mitt Romney.">[6]</a>

She says what every rich Republican is thinking, but doesn't have the balls to come out and say. Maybe she picked up a pair during her 20 year career as an adult film actress.
