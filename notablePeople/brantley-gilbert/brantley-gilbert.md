Brantley Gilbert was born and raised in Jefferson, Georgia.

Gilbert comes from a religious Christian family, and although I couldn't figure out which denomination, Baptist seems at least likely. The country musician said his mother and Jesus are tight,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6HOeb-YuwQ" title="Brantley Gilbert-The truth on old 129 (high q).">[1]</a> but his own devotion and reverence for God were strengthened by a near death experience.

After getting into a serious drunk driving accident, he said he knew God saved him in order to pursue his music career–and pursue it he did.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h6HOeb-YuwQ" title="Brantley Gilbert-The truth on old 129 (high q).">[2]</a> In the title track to his hit album, Halfway to Heaven, in which he describes the experience, he sings that after the accident,

>I'm in church every sunday mornin/ I pray everyday<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/brantleygilbert/halfwaytoheaven.html" title="Brantley Gilbert Lyrics – Halfway To Heaven.">[3]</a>

Judging by the [album cover](https://www.google.com/search?q=album+cover+halfway+to+heaven+brantley+gilbert&hl=en&rlz=1C1ASUT_enUS499US499&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=OhE9UZHeE9StyAHc_IGYAQ&ved=0CAoQ_AUoAQ&biw=1366&bih=643#imgrc=IECYlPtc6giogM%3A%3B--UtlPy3jg2lyM%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Facharts.us%252Fc%252F65562-l.jpg%3Bhttp%253A%252F%252Facharts.us%252Falbum%252F65562%3B500%3B500), that looks to be true. And when asked in one interview who would be the first person he'd like to thank, he said,

>I'd have to say God. I don't think any of this would be possible [without God].<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tasteofcountry.com/brantley-gilbert-acm-nominee-trouble/" title="Brantley Gilbert Interview: ACM New Artist Nominee Reveals What Keeps Him Out of Trouble.">[4]</a>

I'm sure he made his mama proud.


## God Bless the Troops

Gilbert isn't expressly political even though he made it onto Republican Mitt Romney's campaign song list in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/10/mitt-romneys-campaign-rally-play-list-147738.html" title="Mitt Romney&apos;s campaign rally playlist.">[5]</a> It doesn't look like he's made any campaign contributions, and his Twitter feed makes no mention of partisan politics, although he seems to use it as more of a promotional tool than a record of his stream of consciousness.

If there's one issue he seems to be dedicated to though, it's his respect for the troops. On July 4th in 2012, he tweeted a shout-out:

>Happy Independence Day BG Nation…. God Bless America and more importantly our Troops….!<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/BrantleyGilbert/status/220550393095131136" title="BrantleyGilbert: Happy Independence Day BG …">[6]</a>

He has worked with the Boot Campaign which raises awareness and money to help soldiers transition to civilian life after combat.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://kixs.com/brantley-gilbert-helps-out-the-boot-campaign/" title="Brantley Gilbert Helps Out The Boot Campaign.">[7]</a> He also took time out of his touring schedule to visit with and play a few tunes for hospitalized veterans. He said about the experience,

>These men and women have sacrificed their lives for our freedom. . . . I have so much respect for them. It was an honor to be able to spend time with them and hopefully brighten their day a little. I know it has certainly changed my life.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://newyork.cbslocal.com/2012/11/28/brantley-gilbert-visits-with-u-s-veterans/" title="Brantley Gilbert Visits With U.S. Veterans.">[8]</a>

It might not be a political position per se, but it definitely shows some dedication to his country and pride for his military.
