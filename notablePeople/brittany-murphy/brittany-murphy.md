Brittany Murphy was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up in Edison, New Jersey. She died in 2009 in Los Angeles, California of pneumonia, anemia and possible drug overdose.

Rumors abound that Murphy's mother is Jewish (([Brittany Murphy's Mother Was Jewish](http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/22803/brittany-murphy%E2%80%99s-mother-was-jewish). Tablet Mag.)) but that isn't the case. Her late widower, however, Simon Monjack,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.tabletmag.com/scroll/22803/brittany-murphy%E2%80%99s-mother-was-jewish" title="Brittany Murphy&apos;s Mother Was Jewish">[1]</a> was Jewish and the couple were married in a Jewish ceremony.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20037875,00.html" title="Brittany Murphy Marries Writer-Director">[2]</a> Murphy always considered herself a Christian. She said:

>I'm a Christian. I go to church when I can. I was raised Baptist. I went to a Lutheran school. I'm a nondenominational practicing Christian. I have a lot of faith.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005261/bio" title="Brittany Murphy – Biography">[3]</a>

Despite Murphy's adherence to Christianity, her husband protested to her having an autopsy after her death because autopsies are frowned on in that faith.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/2009/12/20/brittany-murphys-husband-doesnt-want-an-autopsy-performed-related-cocaine-is-evil/" title="Brittany Murphy&apos;s Husband Doesn&apos;t Want an Autopsy Performed">[4]</a>

Given her southern roots, if we had to speculate as to the Christian denomination Murphy adhered to, Baptist seems more appropriate than Lutheran. Beyond that, Murphy conquered her fear of flying by praying and declared that Lionel Ritchie was her "guardian angel."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005261/bio" title="Brittany Murphy – Biography">[5]</a>

## Clueless politics

Murphy wasn't much of a political enthusiast. Reports indicate that she was interested in politics, it being one of the many subjects this go-getter educated herself about.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/final-difficult-days-brittany-murphy-70059" title="The Final Difficult Days of Brittany Murphy">[6]</a>

Though Brittany was able to see Obama's rise to power, she didn't comment. She seemed to keep to herself regarding the Bush administration as well. She did, however, in a show of patriotic solidarity, visit the troops in Iraq and Kuwait.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005261/bio" title="Brittany Murphy – Biography">[7]</a>

Other than that, Murphy was largely non-political. No campaign donations to be found, statements about gay marriage or the environment. This girl just wanted to be an entertainer.
