Ariana Grande was born and raised in Boca Raton, Florida.

Grande doesn't give us many clues as to her religious beliefs, but it seems like she might be Christian or Catholic. One site lists her religion as Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allstarpics.net/pic-gallery/ariana-grande-pics.htm" title="Ariana Grande Pics.">[1]</a> but who knows where they're getting their information.

Her Italian heritage<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/40266680152240128" title="ArianaGrande: I am Italian American, half …">[2]</a> suggests a Catholic upbringing, but there's nothing else she's said or done to back that up. She sends prayers out to Twitterland,<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/40269966548795392" title="ArianaGrande: Sending prayers and love to …">[3]</a> but there's no telling if that translates into lighting a candle at church every week.

She expressed some religious tolerance after two of her fans committed suicide due to bullying and abuse. She wrote on her Twitter feed,

>Please be happy and safe and love each other. Support your fellow man, regardless of color, religion, sexuality, body image, ANYTHING.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nickutopia.com/2011/09/12/ariana-grande-suffers-great-loss-speaks-out-against-violence-and-bullying/" title="Ariana Grande Suffers Great Loss – Speaks Out Against Violence and Bullying.">[4]</a>

Chances are that with Grande, even if she is Catholic or some other kind of Christian, she probably isn't terribly devout.


## You're Too Special

By the time Grande voted in her first election, she was already a Democrat. She tweeted her excitement about being part of the democratic process for the first time in 2012 and encouraged her fans to vote as well.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/265732661115494401" title="ArianaGrande: Very excited to be voting for …">[5]</a> About Obama's speech after his victory, she tweeted,

>Obama's speech is so incredible and inspiring! So proud of our country and all the Americans who had their voices heard this election!<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ArianaGrande/status/266071459200372737" title="ArianaGrande: Obama&apos;s speech is so incredible …">[6]</a>

There's no doubt that her support of the Democrats is partly due to the party's stance on gay marriage. She's tweeted her support for the issue several times.<a class="source-citation" href="http://tweetwood.com/conversation/ArianaGrande/BarackObama" title="Twitter conversation between Ariana Grande and Barack Obama.">[7]</a> And it's obviously close to her heart because her brother, with whom she is very close, is gay.<a class="source-citation" href="http://boyculture.typepad.com/boy_culture/2012/09/grande-gesture-teen-star-supports-her-gay-brother.html" title="Grande Gesture: Teen Star Supports Her Gay Brother.">[8]</a>

Her experience with bullying, both directed at her and her brother, have made the issue an important one for Grande. Sparked by the previously mentioned suicide, she wrote a piece in the Huffington Post encouraging young people to respect themselves and ignore bullies. She concluded by saying,

>We're all fabulous. Everyone. Even the bullies, although they might not see it. All we can do is wish them happiness and celebrate our own. Don't ever doubt yourselves or waste a second of your life. It's too short and you're too special.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ariana-grande/post_2809_b_1193895.html" title="Ariana Grande: Even Performers Like Me Get Bullied.">[9]</a>

Regardless of which side of the political aisle you stand on, young people are lucky to have role models like this one.
