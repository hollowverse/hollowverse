Sarah Brightman was born and raised in Berkhamsted, Hertfordshire, England.

I expected to find more on Brightman's Catholic faith, but I could only find one quote which clearly shows her devotion to her religion.Talking about her Christmas album, A Winter Symphony, which features songs heavy on religion like "Silent Night," "Ave Maria," and "In the Bleak Midwinter," Brightman said,

>My family is Catholic, and my mother is very Catholic. The whole Christian side of Christmas has been an important thing in my family. Christmas is actually a very textured moment of the year for me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/music/articles/2008/12/11/20081211brightman.html" title="12/21: Sarah Brightman at Jobing.com Arena.">[1]</a>

Her holiday album isn't the only one with religious songs either. Just looking at titles, she has songs like "[Heaven is Here](http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Heaven-is-Here-lyrics-Sarah-Brightman/4D09B0DD28B61E954825696100133C58)," "[How Can Heaven Love Me?](http://www.metrolyrics.com/how-can-heaven-love-me-lyrics-sarah-brightman.html)" and "[Angel](http://www.lyricsreg.com/lyrics/sarah+brightman/Angel/)." And one of her albums is called Eden.

Maybe she doesn't like to talk about her faith much, maybe people don't ask her very often, or maybe I just couldn't find those interviews. But regardless, she's made it pretty clear that she's a religious Catholic.


## Take that, NASA

The only even remotely political thing that Sarah Brightman has done is try to go to space, or at least pay for a ticket. Brightman outbid NASA–or in other words, the U.S. government–for a spot on a trip up the International Space Station. She reportedly spent more than $50 million for the ticket<a class="source-citation" href="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/space-tourist-sarah-brightman-buys-seat-russian-soyuz/story?id=17384120" title="Space Tourist Sarah Brightman Buys Seat on Russian Soyuz Spacecraft.">[2]</a> and will spend six month training in Russia for the mission.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2012/oct/11/sarah-brightman-space-station" title="Sarah Brightman books flight to space station.">[3]</a> But hey, if you've got more money to spare than the United States, then why not? She said,

>I think it will be a beautiful journey and I think just to look back at our planet from that perspective is life changing, it has to be.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WoGe-9gGMdM" title="Sarah Brightman: my space flight will be &apos;life-changing.&apos;">[4]</a>

It's hardly partisan politics, but it's something all right. In fact, she doesn't appear to have anything to say about the partisan in her country or anywhere else. I guess she's just sticking to peaceful international missions for now. If you know anything else, please give us a holler in the comments!
