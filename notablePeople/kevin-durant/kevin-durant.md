Kevin Durant was born and raised in the Washington D.C. area.

Durant is one of basketball and even professional sports' most devout Christians. Durant attended a Christian school growing up and even now, amidst the fortune and fame, regularly attends church services before games.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blog.beliefnet.com/inspiringathletes/2011/05/nba-all-star-kevin-durant-on-faith-family-and-fame.html" title="NBA All-Star Kevin Durant on faith, family and fame">[1]</a> Durant carries a Bible in a backpack to his post-game interviews, and thanks God for his blessings as a star basketball playerâ€“even when he loses.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.deseretnews.com/article/765585800/Oklahoma-City-Thunders-Kevin-Durant-draws-closer-to-God.html" title="Oklahoma City Thunder&apos;s Kevin Durant draws closer to God">[2]</a>

Durant credits his faith and humility to his mother and various other spiritual "coaches" and says things like:

>I've got a long way to go to become closer to the Lord but hopefully I can continue to stay on the path. I might take a few steps forward and take a couple steps back and take some steps forward, but I want to get better.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blog.beliefnet.com/inspiringathletes/2011/05/nba-all-star-kevin-durant-on-faith-family-and-fame.html" title="NBA All-Star Kevin Durant on faith, family and fame">[3]</a>

## Bro Hug Politics

Durant isn't too political. Maybe his overwhelming humility prevents him from taking a stand on anything. More often than not, being a hardcore Christian pits people against the socially liberal policies of the left (gay marriage, abortion, etc.), though Durant hasn't said anything about these issues. On the other hand, being a black American almost requires you to support Barack Obama.

And Durant and Obama sure looked chummy during a White House basketball court meeting, where they shared a bro hug. Check out the [video](http://www.terezowens.com/obama-and-kevin-durant-hug-like-bros/). Durant said of the meeting:

>It was a good feeling to meet the president. Of course I always wanted to do that. Me being from D.C., it was pretty cool to see him. I was excited to get that opportunity. It's something I'm always going to remember.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.cbssports.com/mcc/blogs/entry/22748484/25695375" title="Kevin Durant meets Barack Obama">[4]</a>

Still, that doesn't indicate anything except that Durant doesn't despise Obama for his policies.
