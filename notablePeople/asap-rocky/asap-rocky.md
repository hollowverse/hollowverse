ASAP Rocky, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, was born and raised in Harlem, New York City.

Rocky doesn't spend a lot of time talking about his religious beliefs, so we're left with song lyrics as clues. Quite a few of his songs have some reference to Christianity, but they're not all praising the Good Lord for all his blessings. In the song "Demons" for example, the hook uses religion to paint a dark picture:

>Demons posted all around me, I can't beat 'em all alone/ These demon thoughts they start to drown me, Lord don't leave me all alone<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/asaprocky/demons.html" title="ASAP ROCKY LYRICS – Demons.">[1]</a>

Then some of his songs evoke God in a not-so-dark but also not-so-devout sense. From "Toast to the Gods":

>Tell me what a good Christian is/ Better yet; When Christmas is/ Waiting on my presence, I must be a gift from heaven/ Cause I'm toasting with the Lord, somebody let the bitches in<a class="source-citation" href="#http://rapgenius.com/Asap-rocky-toast-to-the-gods-lyrics" title="ASAP Rocky – Toast to the Gods Lyrics.">[2]</a>

So I'm going to guess that ASAP Rocky believes in God and considers himself a Christian, but probably doesn't go to church or spend too much time thinking about the intricacies of his faith. In other words, not super religious.


## LiveLoveObama

When a reporter asked ASAP Rocky who he was going to vote for, he said "Obama" as if the guy was crazy to think he would have voted for anyone else. Considering he's a black man in the United States, the rapper had a point. But he definitely seemed a lot more concerned about where the party was going to be on election night rather than impassioned about the political process.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.vibe.com/article/aap-rocky-supports-president-obama-re-election" title="A$AP Rocky Supports President Obama for Re-Election.">[3]</a>

He does have something else in common with the Democrats other than sharing the same skin color as the president–well, sort of. He didn't exactly come out in favor of gay marriage, but he does think that homophobia in hip hop is both close-minded and bad for business. He said,

>People need to leave gay people the fuck alone. Like, who cares? . . . I'm not saying that hip-hop needs gay rappers or anything, but they need to stop being so close-minded because that will just cause the genre to fail. . . . [Hate a person] because they're a thief or a bad person. Don't hate 'em for what they choose to do.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.spinner.com/2012/02/17/asap-rocky-hip-hop-homophobia/" title="ASAP Rocky: Harlem Rapper Says Homophobia in Hip-Hop Is &apos;Retarded.&apos;">[4]</a>

Even though that's all we have on Rocky's political beliefs, it shows that to the extent that he's invested in politics, he a liberal and maybe even a Democrat.
