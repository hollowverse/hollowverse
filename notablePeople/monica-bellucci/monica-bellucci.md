Monica Bellucci was born in Città di Castello, Italy and grew up in San Giustino, Italy.

Bellucci is Italian, and almost by default, a Catholic as a result. And while it is true she grew up Catholic, it's not something she still clings to. She said:

>I come from a Catholic religion, but I'm not Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000899%2Fbio" title="Monica Bellucci – Biography">[1]</a>

Bellucci calls herself an agnostic and explains her view of spirituality this way:

>I am an Agnostic, even though I respect and am interested in all religions. If there's something I believe in, it's a mysterious energy; the one that fills the oceans during tides, the one that unites nature and beings.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monstersandcritics.com%2Fpeople%2FMonica-Bellucci%2Fbiography%2F" title="Monica Bellucci Biography.">[2]</a>

This doesn't appear to be the agnosticism of the logical humanist who says: 'It is impossible to know of or prove the existence of God.' Bellucci seems almost more pantheist with her focus on "nature and beings." Perhaps it's just that you can't always articulate or adhere to a strict ideological framework. Spirituality is more complicated than that.


## Politics of Europeness

Bellucci is Italian, but speaks four languages and has homes across the European continent.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000899%2Fbio" title="Monica Bellucci – Biography">[3]</a> She has said:

>I live in Paris but I feel I am a daughter of Europe.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000899%2Fbio" title="Monica Bellucci – Biography">[4]</a>

Bellucci's husband is famous French actor, Vincent Cassel, and when it comes to living the "liberal" life, these two might take the cake. Bellucci has admitted she doesn't mind if Cassel has sex with other women–as long as he's "elegant." She said:

>It would be ridiculous to ask [fidelity] of him if I hadn't been there for two months. You can't ask such things as who has he been seeing, what has he been up to? It is more respectful and realistic to take the view that you'll be with me when I see you.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celebitchy.com%2F145894%2Fmonica_bellucci_its_ridiculous_to_expect_husband_vincent_cassels_fidelity%2F" title="Monica Bellucci: It&apos;s &quot;ridiculous&quot; to expect Vincent Cassel&apos;s fidelity">[5]</a>

Perhaps Bellucci has evolved beyond the small-mindedness of social convention. She has an interesting view of humanity's evolutionary development, saying:

>The human intelligence has progressed at the technological level; not at the level of feelings.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000899%2Fbio" title="Monica Bellucci – Biography">[6]</a>

But in the mainstream political sphere, Bellucci is more or less uninvolved. She has spoken out about In Vitro fertilization laws in Italy, which are still a remnant of Catholic reproductive policy and do not allow unmarried women to become pregnant via this procedure. Bellucci sees it as unfair and a bit theocratic, saying:

>Women are going abroad but only if they can afford it. It's a political problem or rather an exploitation of religion by politics.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babyrazzi.com%2F2010%2F05%2F24%2Fmonica-bellucci-husband-welcome-their-second-daughter%2F" title="Monica Bellucci &amp; Husband Welcome Their Second Daughter.">[7]</a>
