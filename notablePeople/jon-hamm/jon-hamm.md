Jon Hamm was born in St. Louis, Missouri and grew up there an in Creve Coeur, Missouri.

There is not much information about Hamm's religious views, if there are any. Where he was raised might indicate an affinity for the Baptist Christian faith according to this [map](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151653383943047&set=o.206704599442186&type=1&theater), but nothing from Hamm to be found on the topic of religion.

We do know that he's not Jewish. Perhaps it is because his longtime girlfriend, Jennifer Westfeldt, is Jewish,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.interfaithfamily.com/arts_and_entertainment/popular_culture/Interfaith_Celebrities_The_Long_Line_of_Interfaith_Indianas.shtml" title="The Long Line of Interfaith Indianas">[1]</a> because rumors have proliferated that Hamm is as well. It's become such a phenomenon that sites like "Jew or Not Jew" have profiled Hamm<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=641" title="Jon Hamm">[2]</a> and Google was sued for antisemitism in France because its auto-search function keeps throwing up the term "Jon Hamm Jewish" when people Google the star.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120501/03501218725/google-sued-because-some-people-wonder-if-jon-hamm-is-jewish.shtml" title="Google Sued Because People Wonder If Jon Hamm Is Jewish">[3]</a>

Ultimatley, Hamm seems simply non-religious. Both his parents died when he was young, and talking about that would be a perfect opportunity to talk about "the will of God" or muse that he will see them in the next life. But no. He said:

>Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life–so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.parade.com/celebrity/celebrity-parade/2010/jon-hamm-mad-men.html" title="Jon Hamm: &apos;I Stopped Believing in a Story Book Existence A Long Time Ago.&apos;">[4]</a>

## 

## Southern Democrat

Hamm is a Democrat. He's somewhat active in politics, even tricky at times. For example, he did what you might think would be a non-partisan PSA in 2012 to teach and encourage people to vote early. After a minute or so of innocent mail-in voting instructions, Hamm dropped Obama's campaign website on viewers. Then, one notices the "Vote Obama" posters in the background and by the end, it's evident that it's sponsored by the president's campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/10/30/john-hamm-encourages-colo_n_2046099.html?ncid=edlinkusaolp00000003" title="Jon Hamm Encourages Colorado To Vote Early In New Obama Ad">[5]</a>

Also, Hamm attended the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, South Carolina in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.sfgate.com/news/slideshow/Celebrities-at-DNC-48584.php" title="Celebrities at DNC">[6]</a>

But where he lies on specific issues, we can't say. If Hamm starts spouting from a soapbox, please keep us updated in the comments.
