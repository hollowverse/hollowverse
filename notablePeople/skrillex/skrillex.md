Skrillex, whose real name is Sonny John Moore, was born in Los Angeles, California and grew up there and in San Francisco, Calfornia.

Skrillex appears to be completely non-religious. Others disagree, however–most notably a hilarious satirist with questionable math skills who claims that Skrillex has a pact with Satan:

>Skrillex Uses Satanic and Homosexual Influence to Win Grammys..As long as Skrillex wins Grammys and is accepted by mainstream media, he will claim souls for Satan…<a class="source-citation" href="#http://christwire.org/2012/02/skrillex-uses-satanic-and-homosexual-influence-to-win-grammys/" title="Skrillex Uses Satanic and Homosexual Influence to Win Grammys.">[1]</a>

The author goes on to say that over 100% of gay people listen to Skrillex, so it's difficult to take him seriously as a credible source.

It would appear that in reality, Skrillex's only religion is his music.


## Politics

Skrillex is publicly not associated with any political party, nor has he come out on any hot-button political or social issues.

All we've really got to go on is the fact that Skrillex's girlfriend, Ellie Goulding, once performed for Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.fuse.tv/2012/10/president-obama-likes-ellie-goulding-s-polar-bear-look" title="President Obama Likes Ellie Goulding&apos;s Polar Bear Look">[2]</a>

Based purely on appearances and attitudes (now I might start sounding like our previously mentioned Satan-identifier here), Skrillex seems like he'd be a pretty liberal guy. Keep us updated of any developments in the comments.
