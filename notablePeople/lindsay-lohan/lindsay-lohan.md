Lindsay Lohan was born in New York City and grew up in Merrick and Cold Spring Harbor, both towns on Long Island, New York.

Lohan's heritage is both Irish and Italian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517820/bio" title="Lindsay Lohan – Biography">[1]</a> so it's no surprise that she was raised a Catholic. Her roots in that religion go back quite far, (likely hundreds of years–if not more) and her great-grandfather, John L. Sullivan, was a founder of The Long Island Pro Life Party.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1158246/Lindsay-Lohan-visits-synagogue-attempts-convert-Judaism-girlfriend-Samantha-Ronson.html" title="Lindsay Lohan visits synagogue after she attempts to convert to Judaism for girlfriend Samantha Ronson">[2]</a>

Lohan has experimented with various religions in her media-soaked, tumultuous career. She looked into Kabbalah and Scientology, though her closest call was a near-conversion to Judaism for the sake of her former girlfriend Samantha Ronson.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1158246/Lindsay-Lohan-visits-synagogue-attempts-convert-Judaism-girlfriend-Samantha-Ronson.html" title="Lindsay Lohan visits synagogue after she attempts to convert to Judaism for girlfriend Samantha Ronson">[3]</a> During the relationship, she updated her Facebook status at one point with a simple: "I'm converting" and when asked by paparazzi at a synagogue if she would be changing religions, she replied: "I'm trying." <a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1158246/Lindsay-Lohan-visits-synagogue-attempts-convert-Judaism-girlfriend-Samantha-Ronson.html" title="Lindsay Lohan visits synagogue after she attempts to convert to Judaism for girlfriend Samantha Ronson">[4]</a>

The relationship with Ronson didn't last, however, and most recently, she's declared that she she will be remaining a Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/06/lindsay-lohan-church-of-scientology-not-a-scientologist/" title="Lindsay Lohan – I&apos;m No Scientologist!">[5]</a> Though, given her shenanigans, it wouldn't be too difficult to question her level of devotion to the moral precepts of that faith–or any formal faith for that matter.


## Flip-flopping Lohan

Lohan is a bit back and forth when it comes to politics. Early in her career, she said:

>I don't like to talk about politics. If you say you're a Democrat, that'll turn off Republicans, and that's half of your fan base.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0517820/bio" title="Lindsay Lohan – Biography">[6]</a>

But that didn't last long. In 2008, she endorsed Obama, though it seems as though it was more about not liking Republican vice-Presidential candidate Sarah Palin. Lohan said, (misquoting Palin, incidentally<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xqDKKcdra8" title="Sarah Palin – Pitbull wearing Lipstick">[7]</a> ):

>I really cannot bite my tongue anymore when it comes to Sarah Palin… I would have liked to have remained impartial, however I am afraid that the 'lipstick on a pig' comments will overshadow the issues and the fact that I believe Barack Obama is the best choice, in this election, for president.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.showbizspy.com/article/163257/lindsay-lohan-lashes-out-at-sarah-palin.html" title="Lindsay Lohan Lashes Out At Sarah Palin">[8]</a>

Well, Lohan changed her tune in 2012 when she endorsed Mitt Romney. Indicating she'd given some real thought to the issue, Lohan said:

>I think unemployment is very important for now, so as of now I think [my vote] is Mitt Romney.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/23/lindsay-lohan-tweets-support-for-president-weeks-after-backing-romney/" title="Lindsay Lohan tweets support for President Obama weeks after backing Mitt Romney">[9]</a>

A couple of weeks later, however, Lohan tweeted:

>RT @BarackObama: RT if you're #ProudOfObama as our commander in chief.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2012/10/23/lindsay-lohan-tweets-support-for-president-weeks-after-backing-romney/" title="Lindsay Lohan tweets support for President Obama weeks after backing Mitt Romney">[10]</a>

The pro-Obama tweet quickly disappeared off of Lohan's twitter feed and it was assumed that she was back to being a Romney supporter.

When you add it all up, though, Lohan seems a bit more on the side of liberals and Democrats–particularly as a result of her stance on homosexuality and that she took issue with the Republican view. She said:

>Is it a sin to be gay? Should it be a sin to be straight? Or to use birth control? Or to have sex before marriage? Or even to have a child out of wedlock? Is our country so divided that the Republicans' best hope is a narrow minded, media obsessed homophobe?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.showbizspy.com/article/163257/lindsay-lohan-lashes-out-at-sarah-palin.html" title="Lindsay Lohan Lashes Out At Sarah Palin">[11]</a>

Interestingly, for Catholics, those things are sins.
