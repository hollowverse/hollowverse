David Tennant was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland and raised in Paisley just outside of Glasgow.


## The Minister's Son

To begin with, Tennant's father is a minister for his local Church of Scotland, a Presbyterian church. Although he seems to be close to his father, he doesn't seem quite as devout–admitting that he only goes to church occasionally.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/aug/19/david-tennant-interview" title="David Tennant: &apos;My bedpost really has very few notches&apos; – interview.">[1]</a> Not to say that religion didn't have a huge impression on him. He says it shaped his character, including his sense of guilt and work ethic. But he's unclear where religion and plain humanity meet.

>There's a morality… I think there's a moral compass but whether that comes from religion or just from being a good person, and where one starts and the other begins. . .<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/culture/2011/aug/19/david-tennant-interview" title="David Tennant: &apos;My bedpost really has very few notches.&apos; – interview.">[2]</a>

David Tennant isn't one to spout out about his beliefs, or even give that many interviews. He says that just because someone is famous doesn't mean what they have to say is interesting or important.

>It's very easy to get seduced into believing your opinion is informed just because people ask you for it.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.team-tennant.com/article/id232.html" title="It&apos;s OK To Think Doctor Who Is Gay Says David Tennant.">[3]</a>

## David Cameron, a terrifying prospect

But that certainly doesn't mean Tennant doesn't have opinions. He is a long-time supporter of the Labour party, and threw his celebrity behind Gordon Brown in the 2010 election, even doing a voice-over part in a television advertisement for his campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7580270/General-Election-2010-David-Tennant-and-Sean-Pertwee-star-in-Labour-advert.html" title="eneral Election 2010: David Tennant and Sean Pertwee star in Labour advert.">[4]</a> He was especially critical of prime minister, David Cameron.

>I would rather have a prime minister who is the cleverest person in the room, than a prime minister who looks good in a suit. I think David Cameron is a terrifying prospect.<a class="source-citation" href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8449895.stm" title="Doctor Who star David Tennant &apos;backs Gordon Brown.&apos;">[5]</a>

The actor appears to feel most strongly about environmental issues and climate change. He was voted "Greenest Star on the Planet" by fans for Playhouse Disney's Playing for the Planet Awards.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/262420-tennant-voted-planets-greenest-star" title="Tennant voted planet&apos;s greenest star.">[6]</a> He also appeared in videos for Oxfam challenging people to test their knowledge on climate change in order to promote aweareness about the issue.<a class="source-citation" href="https://www.oxfam.org.au/media/2009/11/oxfam-launches-online-climate-change-challenge/" title="Oxfam launches Online Climate Change Challenge.">[7]</a> He's the first to say, though, that he's no expert–just a guy trying to do what's right. About his hybrid car, he said,

>Now, I'm clearly no Al Gore, but I liked the idea of doing my bit.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.team-tennant.com/article/id232.html" title="It&apos;s OK To Think Doctor Who Is Gay Says David Tennant.">[8]</a>

Tennant also thinks gay rights is a no-brainer. When teased for being gay–which he is not–he said it didn't bother him because, "Why would it?"<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.team-tennant.com/article/id232.html" title="It&apos;s OK To Think Doctor Who Is Gay Says David Tennant.">[9]</a>
