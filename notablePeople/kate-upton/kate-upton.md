Kate Upton was born in St. Joseph, Michigan and raised in Melbourne, Florida.

We can be pretty sure the young model is a Christian, and pretty devout at that. But all the details of her faith remain a mystery for now. Upton has two tattoos, a horse on her wrist and a cross on the inside of her finger. And she didn't just do it on a whim.

>You have to think hard with a tattoo. What will I love for the rest of my life?<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.gq.com/women/photos/201207/kate-upton-gq-july-2012-cover-story" title="Kate Upton: American Bombshell.">[1]</a>

## The Naughty Christian

But just because she decided to permanently ink the symbol of her savior's death on her body, doesn't mean she won't have a little fun with religion from time to time. She sparked rage in the Catholic community by dressing in a nun's habit and bikini (nun-kini) for the movieÂ The Three Stooges.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2012/04/kate-upton-sexy-nun-monokini-religion-god-slams-right-wing-group" title="Kate Upton&apos;s Sexy Nun Monokini Is &apos;Turning Religion, God and Belief Into A Punch Line,&apos; Slams Right Wing Group.">[2]</a>

And she didn't exactly endear herself to the conservative Christians when she appeared, let's say, "getting intimate" with a Carl's Jr. hamburger in a television ad.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://losangeles.grubstreet.com/2012/02/religious-guy-upset-over-kate-upton-carls-jr-ads.html" title="Religious Sexpert Wants Kate Upton&apos;s Carl&apos;s Jr. Ad Pulled.">[3]</a>

But Upton is just a young woman at the top of her game trying to have a good time. She's clearly a Christian and not trying to offend anyone.

>I can see why the Catholic Church would be upset with me. But it was just for fun, and I try not to take it more seriously than that.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.gq.com/women/photos/201207/kate-upton-gq-july-2012-cover-story" title="Kate Upton: American Bombshell.">[4]</a>

Upton spends much more of her time in photo shoots and enjoying her sudden rise to supermodel stardom than she does on the intricacies of the American political debate. But if she paid attention to the debate in her own household, chances are she's in line with the Republicans.

## Uncle Fred, Republican

Her uncle is Republican Representative Fred Upton from Michigan. As chairman of the Committee on Energy and Commerce, he is one of the most powerful members of the House of Representatives. And he has been serving in Congress since before she was born, so it's safe to say she's been around Republican politics her whole life.

Uncle Upton said of his niece on Fox News,

>She's a great gal. It's been fun to watch her grow up. She's only 19, but we're all proud of Kate.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72967.html" title="Rep. Upton on his niece Kate Upton: &apos;A great gal.">[5]</a>

Hopefully the backlash from Kate's naughty hamburger ad and scandalous nun-kini won't affect the Congressman's next bid for office. But then again, it could help bring some enamored frat boys to the polls.
