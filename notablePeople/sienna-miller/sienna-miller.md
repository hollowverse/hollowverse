Sienna Miller was born in New York City and raised in London, England.

Miller's father was Jewish,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1275373/KATIE-NICHOLL-Sienna-Miller-turns-Kabbalah.html" title="Katie Nicholl: Sienna Miller turns to Kabbalah">[1]</a> though multiple reports, including one from his ex-wife, have him as a member of a strange and mysterious cult.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.entertainmentwise.com/news/17903/Sienna-Millers-Father-Is-In-Religious-Cult" title="Sienna Miller&apos;s Father Is In A Religious Cult!">[2]</a> However, it would seem that occurred after Sienna became an independent woman. So ultimately, it seems that neither Judaism nor whatever cult religion found its way into her fathers heart, transmitted to Sienna's beliefs. She spent most of her career up to this point leaving religion out of the conversation, even though, like many Brits, she attended school at an institution with an Anglican tradition.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/sienna-miller.html" title="Sienna Miller – Biography on Bio">[3]</a>

However, something changed because Miller has been spotted both wearing the infamous Kabbalah red string bracelet and attending the Kabbalah Center in New York City.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1275373/KATIE-NICHOLL-Sienna-Miller-turns-Kabbalah.html" title="Katie Nicholl: Sienna Miller turns to Kabbalah">[4]</a> Is it celebrity fashion? The fact that she's good friends with Madonna?<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227/bio" title="Sienna Miller – Biography">[5]</a> Or is it that she wants to explore her Jewish roots from a different angle?

She won't comment, so it's hard to know. Let us know, readers, if you hear anything.


## Too liberal for Labour

Miller has described herself as a liberal–even too liberal for Britain's Labour Party, but she'll take them in a pinch. She said:

>I'm a liberal at heart; I don't want to vote Conservative. I'd vote Green, but I know it's a wasted vote or whatever, but it's the only party with integrity. I'm not saying we live in a dictatorship, in a fascist regime, because that's really disrespectful to people who do live in countries that are.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1092227/bio" title="Sienna Miller – Biography">[6]</a>

I don't know, it kind of seems like she is saying Brits live in a fascist dictatorship. Anyway…

Miller has also joined a slew of other celebrities (perhaps Hugh Grant being the most vocal) in condemning the British press, particularly after the [News of the World](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/News_International_phone_hacking_scandal) affair. To Miller, and these other celebrities, the press has too much leeway. She said:

>I would often find myself almost daily, I was 21, at midnight running down down a dark street on my own with 10 big men chasing me. The fact that they had cameras in their hands meant that that was legal. But if you take away the cameras, what have you got? You've got a pack of men chasing a woman, and obviously that's a very intimidating situation to be in.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15870595" title="Leveson Inquiry: Actress Sienna Miller gives evidence">[7]</a>

That is certainly disturbing. But perhaps Miller doesn't realize that a heavily-regulated press is a pretty good indicator of a fascist society.
