Kelly Rowland was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up there until she was eight-years-old when she and her mother moved to Houston, Texas.

Rowland is a Methodist<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/kelly-rowland" title="Kelly Rowland&apos;s Charity Work, Events and Causes">[1]</a> and is very devout. Like many religious stars, she credits her success to God, saying:

>It's been my faith that has gotten me to where I am right now. It's been my faith that has kept me in the game for 15 years when I wanted to give up at certain times.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/kelly-rowland-cant-be-without-her-bible-on-tour-69264/" title="Kelly Rowland Can&apos;t Be Without Her Bible on Tour">[2]</a>

Rowland's music career began in church<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6480327" title="Kelly Rowland on Destiny&apos;s Child and Her Gospel Turn">[3]</a> and much of Rowland's charity work revolves around her Houston Methodist church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/kelly-rowland" title="Kelly Rowland&apos;s Charity Work, Events and Causes">[4]</a> Now, she says she can't go on tour without her Bible.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/kelly-rowland-cant-be-without-her-bible-on-tour-69264/" title="Kelly Rowland Can&apos;t Be Without Her Bible on Tour">[5]</a> Really, Rowland "can't live" without her faith:

>I can't live without it. As kids we were so on fire for God… If all this were taken away from me right now I would still have my faith. If you don't have faith the world will eat you alive.<a class="source-citation" href="http://news.rin.ru/eng/news///15397/" title="Kelly Rowland couldn&apos;t live without religion">[6]</a>

## Politics of Destiny

Rowland is a Democrat and an Obama supporter–though her support is a bit subdued compared to many other celebrities. She mostly shows her Obama allegiance through her Twitter account–tweeting quotes from both the president<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebritytweet.com/KELLYROWLAND/link/243902088239783936/" title="Kelly Rowland">[7]</a> and the first lady.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/KELLYROWLAND/status/243435437681680384" title="Kelly Rowland: Another good Michelle Obama…">[8]</a>

Proof that Rowland takes at least some liberal positions is her unwavering support of and by the gay community. In Australia, she just came out and said it:

>I think anyone who wants to be married should be married it doesn't matter if you are gay, straight or whatever, it's a celebration of love. Who am I to judge anybody?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/sydney-confidential/kelly-rowland-believes-in-female-leaders-and-would-date-a-sydney-man/story-e6frewz0-1225898009167" title="Kelly Rowland believes in female leaders and would date a Sydney man">[9]</a>

She participates in gay rallies and parades<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgsIi7FdTOA" title="Kelly Rowland interviewed by Perez Hilton">[10]</a> and is quick to express her gratitude to the gay community for their continued support of her and her music, saying:

>My gay fans are the reason I'm here, you know what I mean. For me, the gay community provides so much strength and I really say this with from the heart.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.contactmusic.com/news/kelly-rowland-gay-fans-give-me-strength_1279288" title="Kelly Rowland: Gay Fans Give Me Strength">[11]</a>
