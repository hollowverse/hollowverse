Tony Parker, full name William Anthony Parker was born in Bruges, Belgium. His father was also a basketball player and moved the family often. Parker grew up in such places as Gravelines, Denain, Fécamp and Rouen, all in France.

Parker appears to be a Catholic. Not only because he is French, but also because his wedding to American TV star, Eva Longoria was celebrated in full Catholic style in Paris' Eglise Saint-Germain l'Auxerrois,<a class="source-citation" href="http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/evatony.htm" title="Eva Longoria and Tony Parker Marriage Profile">[1]</a> a 7th Century Catholic cathedral.

Other than that, Parker is a blank page–no mentions of God or church on his [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/tonyparker), no crediting God to his wins and/or losses during post-game interviews. He's probably a cultural, non-practicing Catholic. Of course, I could be wrong, at which point you commenters will tell me. So let's move on to:


## Equally vague politics section!

Parker is French, by choice apparently.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.48minutesofhell.com/the-frenchness-of-tony-parker" title="The Frenchness of Tony Parker">[2]</a> I would think that between his marriage to an American and the fact that he's lived in the U.S. for quite a while now, he'd be able to become a U.S. citizen. But he doesn't appear to have done that. He said about his country:

>It's a beautiful country, a country of love…<a class="source-citation" href="http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/evatony.htm" title="Eva Longoria and Tony Parker Marriage Profile">[3]</a>

That being the case, his only political position I can find is that, in France, he supported Barack Obama's bid for president in 2008. This is referred to on his French [Wikipedia](http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tony_Parker#Poker) page, with a citation to an unlinked magazine article.

Plus, this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VBcfOh1JTBY) is entitled, in French: "Tony Parker supports Obama." It's an interview with half a dozen French journalists and I'm assuming Parker explains why he supports Obama. From the little French I know, I was able to pick out a mention of his then-wife Eva Longoria, who also was an Obama supporter and that there are many problems in the United States, particularly with the economy. I imagine Parker saw Obama as the man to fix them.

If any of you out there are better in French and want to give a translation, please do.

Lastly, Parker said something–a bit strange–but might indicate a more socially liberal worldview:

>Well, actually, I'm a bisexual lesbian in a man's body… but it's more complicated than that.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/t/tony_parker.html?vm=l" title="Tony Parker Quotes">[4]</a>

Seems kind of complicated actually.
