Zlatan Ibrahimovic was born and raised in Malmö, Sweden.

Ibrahimovic was born to a Muslim father and a Catholic mother, but now practices the religion of his mother. He described himself as "very Catholic"<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.elentorno.com/noticia/37724//" title="Zlatan Ibrahimovic: &quot;El gol no lo es todo para mí, no estoy preocupado.&quot;">[1]</a> and even has a tattoo across his left side that reads, in English, "Only God Can Judge Me."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://fcbtransfers.blogspot.com/2009/08/eleven-tattoos-of-zlatan.html" title="The eleven tattoos of Zlatan.">[2]</a> That wasn't necessarily an exclusively religious statement however. It also could have been a response to critics of his abrasive personality and wild lifestyle.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2233669/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-The-craziest-superstar-planet.html" title="Zlatan Ibrahimovic: The craziest superstar on the planet.">[3]</a>

I found an image or two of him praying on the field,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/may/13/football-transfer-rumours" title="Football transfer rumours: Manchester City on spending spree.">[4]</a> but nothing about him attending church or meeting the pope or anything else really. Except for a profession of love for (arguably) the world's most popular sport:

>Football is a religion in its own right, and everyone is welcome.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blogs.bettor.com/Football-is-a-religion-in-its-own-right,-says-Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-a172637" title="Football is a religion in its own right, says Zlatan Ibrahimovic.">[5]</a>

Well said, Zlatan. Well said.


## Non-political Politics

Politics revolves around Ibrahimovic more than he immerses himself in it. He's often mentioned in conversations about immigration in Sweden. Ibrahimovic was born of a Bosnian father and a Croatian mother and grew up in a rough immigrant district. Sweden's liberal immigration policies and its generous social welfare programs cause some Swedes to resent the immigrant population–and in turn the famous footballer.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/research-projects/players-and-migration/immigration-in-sweden/" title="Immigration in Sweden.">[6]</a> Although it's a minority viewpoint, one unimpressed citizen wrote,

>Zlatan Ibrahimovic isn't Swedish. Swedish citizen? Yes, of course. An ethnic Swede that should represent our land, culture, and people? No.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sites.duke.edu/wcwp/research-projects/players-and-migration/immigration-in-sweden/" title="Immigration in Sweden.">[7]</a>

Ibrahimovic also became the target of outrage from some French politicians in 2012 when it was announced that his new French football club would be paying him an €11.3 million post-tax salary. The French budget minister called the figure "indecent," but considering the country is set to tax his income at 75%, it seems to me like France is the real winner. Ibrahimovic himself said,

>I don't understand all the criticism. After all, the more money I earn, the more tax France receives.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2233669/Zlatan-Ibrahimovic-The-craziest-superstar-planet.html" title="Zlatan Ibrahimovic: The craziest superstar on the planet.">[8]</a>

And anyway, who could complain when he scores goals like [this one](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Xh_KNH8QqSw)? But when it comes down to it, Ibrahimovic seems pretty much non-political. It's just when you're as high profile as he is, you're bound to get dragged in one way or another.
