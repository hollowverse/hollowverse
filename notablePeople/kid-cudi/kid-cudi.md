Kid Cudi, whose real name is Scott Ramon Seguro Mescudi, was born and raised in Cleveland, Ohio.

He hasn't said anything about his religious upbringing or current beliefs. Most of the speculation about Kid Cudi's religiosity revolves around his song, "Prayer," which does contain a part of the Catholic Evening Prayer and references, among other things, a purpose for Kid Cudi given to him by God and speculation about meeting God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/kidcudi/theprayer.html" title="Kid Cudi Lyrics: The Prayer">[1]</a>

Politically, Kid Cudi is even more ambiguous. He has expressed a sort of support for Obama, indicating he is probably a Democrat.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://datnewcudi.com/2009/01/17/kid-cudi-talks-mr-h-obama-and-william/" title="Kid Cudi Talks Mr. H, Obama and will.i.am">[2]</a>
