Minka Kelly was born in Los Angeles, California, and grew up in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Kelly appears to be entirely non-religious. Of the many Google searches performed, the only hint of religion, spirituality, or lack thereof that came up was that she celebrated Passover once with Mandy Moore.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2127092/Minka-Kelly-leaves-rumoured-boyfriend-Wilmer-Valderramas-arms-celebrate-Passover-ex-Mandy-Moore.html" title="Minka Kelly leaves rumoured boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama&apos;s arms to celebrate Passover with his ex Mandy Moore.">[1]</a> There isn't any indication that the actress is Jewish, and her Irish and French ancestry<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.irishcentral.com/story/ent/amyandrews_gossipgirl/watch-our-derek-jeter-minka-kelly-is-esquires-sexiest-woman-alive-104748459.html" title="Watch out Derek Jeter, Minka Kelly is Esquire&apos;s sexiest woman alive.">[2]</a> doesn't really scream Jewish. If her ancestry does scream Catholic, there's no evidence of that either.

If you've got any information that I missed, please let us know in the comments. Otherwise, we'll slap a non-religious label on this one until further notice.


## Hollywood Democrat

She has only slightly more to say about politics, but enough that we know she's a supporter of the Democrats. Most of what we know is from her Twitter feed. First of all, she loves Michelle Obama, and is interested enough in the Democratic platform to have watched her speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. She quoted the First Lady on Twitter when she wrote,

>It's not about how much money you make. It's about the difference you make in people's lives. #MichelleObama. I love her…<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.justjared.com/2012/09/08/minka-kelly-i-love-michelle-obama/" title="Minka Kelly: I Love Michelle Obama!">[3]</a>

She also used Twitter to share a link on Barack Obama's campaign website during the 2012 presidential election. The link described an editorial written by a fellow co-star and a producer on the TV show Friday Night Lights about how women on the show would support the Democrats in the election.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/minkakelly/status/263409209205477377" title="minkakelly: Women of Friday Night Lights …">[4]</a>

And finally, just days before the same election, she retweeted a not very sympathetic video entitled, "What Top Republicans say about Mitt Romney."<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/minkakelly" title="Minka Kelly (minkakelly) on Twitter.">[5]</a>

So, we've got no doubt about which ticket she voted for. Hopefully in the future we'll get a little more from her on specific issues, but in the meantime I guess we'll assume she's towing the party line.
