Giuliana Rancic, who's maiden name is Giuliana DePandi, was born in Naples, Italy and grew up in Bethesda, Maryland, United States.

Rancic is an Italian, so it naturally follows that she would be Catholic–and she certainly is! Most of her statements regarding her religion revolve around her marriage with Bill Rancic. Of their wedding, Bill said:

>This is the real deal so we wanted a very old school, full Catholic mass.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/stars/bill-rancic.html" title="Bill Rancic">[1]</a>

It's been reported that ever since the Rancics began dating, they've been attending Mass together every week. Giuliana explains why:

>Bill and I are both Catholic and go to church every Sunday. We have been truly blessed and feel it is important to be grateful for what we have and show our gratitude every day of our lives.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.stylenetwork.com/articles/giuliana_rancics_guide_los_angeles/3491" title="Giuliana Rancic&apos;s Guide to Los Angeles">[2]</a>

There's at least one official Catholic Church policy the couple is choosing to ignore, however, and that's the church's stance on IVF (in vitro fertilization). Rancic has attempted IVF three times–once she had a miscarriage and the third time she discovered she had breast cancer, and the medication from her treatment interfered. Eventually, she found a surrogate mother to carry their child.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.cnn.com/2012/11/12/living/health-giuliana/index.html" title="Giuliana Rancic: How I got through the tough stuff.">[3]</a>

Still, according to Rancic, her trials have only strengthened her faith. She said:

>We go to church every Sunday. And we did before, but it never meant as a much as it does now. We prayed on our own, but now we prayed together and you'll never know how much that means until you do it. Bill and I have changed our lives in that one way.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/giuliana-rancic-more-religious-since-breast-cancer-66795/" title="Giuliana Rancic More Religious Since Breast Cancer">[4]</a>

## Semi-objective politics

Rancic, who is a journalist, feels that she shouldn't comment on her political views. Given her Catholicism, we might assume she holds some conservative social views, but that doesn't appear to be the case. In fact, the opposite seems true. Obviously her views on IVF are clear, but she also appears to be in support of gay marriage. During the Miss USA competition in 2009, Miss California shared her conservative views on the topic,<a class="source-citation" href="http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2009/04/miss_california_controversy.html" title="Under God: Miss California Controversy">[5]</a> and Rancic shot back on Twitter:

>i know i'm a journalist, and i should be objective…but she is an ignorant discrace and she makes me sick to my stomach.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.tmz.com/2009/04/21/e-vs-access-battle-of-the-twits/" title="E! vs. Access – Battle of the Twits">[6]</a>

I'd say she's quite liberal. Even so, no Obama endorsements or Romney condemnations from this lady.
