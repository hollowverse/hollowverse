Val Kilmer was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

Kilmer grew up as, and is currently a Christian Scientist. Or, to clarify, as he said in an interview in 2005,

>Well, I am trying to be. It is quite a challenging faith.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esquire.com%2Ffeatures%2FESQ0705VALKILMER_120" title="Crazy Things Seem Normal . . . Normal Things Seem Crazy.">[1]</a>

Despite that statement, Kilmer is clearly very devoted spiritually. He said,

>I am a religious person. I do pray for specific needs. I do read the Bible every Sunday. I've read the Bible all of my life. I also pray for things that are going on in the world; it has given me a deeper sense of responsibility as a person.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-1217585%2FVal-Kilmer-shows-spiritual-visits-Wailing-Wall-Jerusalem.html" title="Val Kilmer shows his spiritual side as he visits the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.">[2]</a>

He also wrote, directed, and starred in a play about the relationship between the founder of Christian Science, Mary Baker Eddy, and Mark Twain.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F03%2F26%2Fval-kilmers-one-man-show_n_1381279.html" title="Val Kilmer&apos;s One Man Show: &apos;Citizen Twain&apos; To Run At The Hollywood Forever Cemetery, Kilmer Hopes To &apos;Be Redeemed.&apos;">[3]</a> He made a pilgrimage to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-1217585%2FVal-Kilmer-shows-spiritual-visits-Wailing-Wall-Jerusalem.html" title="Val Kilmer shows his spiritual side as he visits the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.">[4]</a> And to top it all off, here was the actor's Twitter message over Christmas in 2012 from the song "Little Town of Bethlehem:"

>How silently, how silently/ The wondrous gift is given!/ So God imparts to human hearts/ The blessings of His heaven.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FValEKilmer%2Fstatus%2F283611989987692544" title="ValEKilmer: How silently, how silently The …">[5]</a>

And there you have it.


## Just looking for ways to contribute

Kilmer's politics are definitely left-leaning, and he's a registered Democrat,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F29048706%2F%23.UUzYvxyG2wc" title="Val Kilmer ponders running for governor.">[6]</a> but he seems to lean a little left of the mainstream party. He voted for Obama, at least in 2008,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F29048706%2F%23.UUzYvxyG2wc" title="Val Kilmer ponders running for governor.">[7]</a> but the majority of his campaign contributions went to the more liberal independent candidate Ralph Nader that year.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org%2Findivs%2Fsearch.php%3Fname%3Dkilmer%252C%2Bval%26state%3D%26zip%3D%26employ%3D%26cand%3D%26c2012%3DY%26c2010%3DY%26c2008%3DY%26sort%3DN%26capcode%3Dbptxq%26submit%3DSubmit%2Byour%2BDonor%2BQuery" title="Donor Lookup: Find Individual and Soft Money Contributors.">[8]</a>

Although he doesn't get himself too entrenched in the latest Hollywood liberal causes, Kilmer does appear to be concerned with environmental issues.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fplanetforward.ca%2Fblog%2Fval-kilmer-slashes-the-asking-price-on-his-eco-ranch%2F" title="Val Kilmer slashes the asking price of his eco-ranch.">[9]</a> And he considered running for governor of New Mexico at one point because, as he said,

>I'm just looking for ways to be contributive. And if that ends up being where I can make a substantial contribution, then I'll run.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcnews.com%2Fid%2F29048706%2F%23.UUzYvxyG2wc" title="Val Kilmer ponders running for governor.">[10]</a>

Well, that hasn't happened yet, but keep us informed, Hollowverse readers. We could have another Hollywood politician on our hands.
