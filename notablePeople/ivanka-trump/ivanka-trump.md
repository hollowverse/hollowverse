Ivanka Trump, daughter and heiress of real estate and T.V. mogul, Donald Trump, was raised a Presbyterian, according to sources indicating that her father is and has been a devout Presbyterian.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/donald-trump-on-faith-i-am-christian-sunday-church-person-49797/" title="Donald Trump on Faith: I am a Christian, Sunday Church Person">[1]</a> Ivanka was born on October 30, 1981 in New York City to Donald and Ivana Trump.

However, Christianity didn't really stick for Ivana. In 2008, after a long courtship with Jewish real estate mogul, Jared Kushner, Trump converted to Judaism so the couple could wed.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.haaretz.com/jewish-world/2.209/report-tycoon-donald-trump-s-daughter-converting-to-judaism-1.256326" title="Report: Tycoon Donald Trump&apos;s daughter converting to Judaism">[2]</a> Now, the paparazzi consider it a story when they see her going to synagogue,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.jta.org/2013/09/30/arts-entertainment/paparazzi-catch-ivanka-trump-going-to-synagogue-were-pretty-sure" title="Paparazzi catch Ivanka Trump going to synagogue (we&apos;re pretty sure)">[3]</a> but she's not too keen to talk much about her faith.

## The Trump Card

Ivanka's father, Donald, is loud and proud about his politics. He's a socially and fiscally conservative Republican and a constant thorn in Obama's side. Donald has proclaimed himself pro-life, anti-gay marriage and very anti-Obama. At times, his stunts–such as demanding Obama's birth certificate to prove he is in fact an American citizen, garner quite a bit of criticism. And Ivanka is asked to either condemn her father or defend him. She defends him.<a class="source-citation" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWpLk6HWcIE" title="Ivanka Trump on her father, husband and daughter – The View">[4]</a> It's enough to assume she's probably a conservative Republican as well.

Luckily we don't have to assume. She endorsed Mitt Romney for president in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="http://thehill.com/video/campaign/218769-ivanka-trump-endorses-romney-praises-his-business-intelligence" title="Ivanka Trump endorses Romney, praises his &apos;business intelligence.&apos;">[5]</a>

She did throw a party for, and donate $40,000 to, Democratic New Jersey Senate candidate, Cory Booker, in 2013.<a class="source-citation" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/07/ivanka-trump-switches-teams-for-cory-booker/" title="Ivanka Trump switches teams for Cory Booker">[6]</a> So, maybe she switched teams? We'll just have to keep our eyes peeled and let us know in the comments if anything interesting happens.
