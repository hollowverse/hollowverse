Elsa Pataky was born and raised in Madrid, Spain.

Everybody–or anybody who cares to guess–seems to think Pataky is Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="http://lists.lucywho.com/roman-catholic-celebrities-c19254569/e.html" title="List of Roman Catholic celebrities.">[1]</a> I agree that if she is religious at all, Catholic is pretty likely considering she grew up in one of the most Catholic countries around.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Spain" title="Religion in Spain.">[2]</a> But the question is whether or not she's religious.

Pataky doesn't have a Twitter account as far as I could tell, so no help there. She doesn't wear a cross out in public; she doesn't send out prayers or count her blessings; and if she baptized her kid, the paparazzi never got its gossip-hungry paws on the event.

Maybe she has some Catholic relatives, maybe she went to church on Christmas and Easter when she was a kid, or maybe she didn't. But it doesn't appear that Pataky is religious these days. Or political for that matter.

Pataky doesn't have a thing to say about politics. She's either really good at keeping her private life private, or she doesn't engage in the political process. The closest thing to a statement I could pull from Pataky was her support for a breast cancer charity.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2240317/Gorgeous-green-Ella-Pataky-glows-red-carpet-shredded-gown-home-city-Madrid.html" title="Gorgeous in green! Ella Pataky glows on the red carpet in shredded gown in her home city of Madrid.">[3]</a> Not very political.
