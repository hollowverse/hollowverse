G-Dragon, whose real name is Kwon Ji-yong, was born and raised in Seoul, South Korea.

A staggering number of fan sites list G-Dragon as a Christian.<a class="source-citation" href="http://korea-boyband.blogspot.com/2009/11/g-dragon-big-bang-leader-profile.html" title="G-Dragon Big Bang Leader Profile">[1]</a> I'd imagine there's something to it, though I couldn't find any confirmation straight from the dragon's mouth. What I did find, however, was his bandmate, Daesung, talk extensively about his Christian faith and the fact that he took G-Dragon to church with him a couple of times. Perhaps the most telling part of the interview was when Daesung said:

>G-Dragon hyung belongs to a church himself, but hasn't gone in quite awhile.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allkpop.com/2011/11/daesung-talks-about-his-faith-g-dragon-in-latest-interview" title="Daesung talks about his faith &amp; G-Dragon in latest interview">[2]</a>

We'd be tempted to assume that G-Dragon isn't all that devout in his faith, except for the fact that Daesung reported that G-Dragon asked to accompany Daesung to church, enjoyed singing the hymn, "I love my Jesus," asked to come again the next week and spoke of a significant moment between the church's head pastor and G-Dragon.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allkpop.com/2011/11/daesung-talks-about-his-faith-g-dragon-in-latest-interview" title="Daesung talks about his faith &amp; G-Dragon in latest interview">[3]</a>

Plus, G-Dragon tweeted "Merry Christmas baby" on Christmas Eve 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/IBGDRGN" title="G-Dragon (IBGDRGN) on Twitter">[4]</a>

But that's about it. If any of you K-Pop fans out there have anything better, please let us know in the comments.


## A worldwide phenomenon and pride of a nation

G-Dragon is, perhaps along with Psy, a de facto ambassador of South Korean culture to the world and a star in the rising K-Pop phenomenon. He is also a fashion trailblazer. It was the latter that got him a mention in the 50 reasons Seoul, South Korea is the best city in the world according to CNN.<a class="source-citation" href="http://travel.cnn.com/seoul/life/50-reasons-why-seoul-worlds-greatest-city-534720" title="50 reasons why Seoul is the world&apos;s greatest city">[5]</a> That is a matter of geopolitics in my book.

But whether or not G-Dragon takes any political positions himself, he either doesn't say or he does–in Korean.

He was the focus of a scandal involving marijuana, in which he was arrested in S. Korea, given a urine test–which he passed–then given a hair test, where small traces of marijuana was found.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allkpop.com/2011/10/mystery-shrouds-g-dragons-marijuana-case" title="Mystery Shrouds G-Dragons Marijuana Case">[6]</a> Apparently, weed is a pretty big deal there in Korea! Hair tests?

Anyway, G-Dragon blamed the whole affair on the misdiagnosis of a cigarette given to him by a fan at a party, and all seems to be well.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.allkpop.com/2012/02/g-dragon-breaks-his-silence-regarding-marijuana-scandal" title="G-Dragon breaks his silence regarding marijuana scandal">[7]</a> I'd be tempted to say G-Dragon might be a lobbyist for the legalization of marijuana in S. Korea, but it seems like it would be a lost cause.
