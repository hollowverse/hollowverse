Elizabeth Hurley was born in Basingstoke, Hampshire, England and grew up in Hampshire.

Hurley was raised by a lapsed Irish Catholic father<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gossiprocks.com/elizabeth-hurley" title="Elizabeth Hurley">[1]</a> and an Anglican mother,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.zimbio.com/Elizabeth+Hurley+Bio" title="Elizabeth Hurley Bio">[2]</a> so we know her upbringing was at least Christian in name. However, she was known to associate with "New Age Travelers" in her youth,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gossiprocks.com/elizabeth-hurley" title="Elizabeth Hurley">[3]</a> though I'm not quite sure what that means. But it could indicate that she wasn't particularly loyal to Christianity. Much of the religious evidence from her adult life corroborates that view.

For example, she once tweeted:

>'Religion is for people who believe in hell; Spirituality is for those who've been there.' Not sure who said that, but what do you think?<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ElizabethHurley/status/179191413211275266" title="Twitter/Elizabeth Hurley: &apos;Religion is for people who…&apos;">[4]</a>

Glad she asked. I think it means she's of the "spiritual, not religious" school of celebrity.

We also know that she's down with Hinduism–even if it's not down with her. Hurley married a Hindu Indian named Arun Nayar in 2007. The couple had two ceremonies: a British civil ceremony and a traditional Hindu ceremony in India.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.wedlok.com/lasvegaswedding/celebrities/liz_hurleys_interfaith_marriage_contested_by_tradi_1-110158.html" title="Liz Hurley&apos;s Interfaith Marriage Contested by Traditionalists">[5]</a> But because Hurley isn't a Hindu, the groom's parents disowned the couple<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-447652/Jail-threat-Liz-hubby-laws-rage-religious-violations.html" title="Jail threat for Liz and hubby as in-laws rage over religious violations">[6]</a> and Hindu traditionalists even called for Hurley to be arrested under an arcane Indian law that states:

>It is against the law to marry in a Hindu ceremony if your are not a Hindu and if you put forth a "deliberate and malicious acts intended to outrage religious feelings."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.wedlok.com/lasvegaswedding/celebrities/liz_hurleys_interfaith_marriage_contested_by_tradi_1-110158.html" title="Liz Hurley&apos;s Interfaith Marriage Contested by Traditionalists">[7]</a>

Nothing came of it ultimately, and Hurley later divorced Nayar. But I imagine she's not too keen on Hinduism.


## Bedazzled politicians

Hurley's not the most political sex goddess in the world, but there are a few things worth mentioning. First of all, she lives on an organic farm and promotes the organic food lifestyle,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/2055134/Elizabeth-Hurley-cooking-up-new-recipes.html" title="Elizabeth Hurley cooking up new recipes">[8]</a> indicating somewhat left-of-center leanings.

In terms of British politics, she's mostly saved her comments for beauty advice, telling David Cameron (who she thinks is "super-sexy" by the way) to lay off on the makeup during televised debates.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/celebritynews/7604097/Elizabeth-Hurley-prepares-for-new-electoral-role.html" title="Elizabeth Hurley prepares for new electoral role">[9]</a>

And though it's far from a solid endorsement, she tweeted an Obama quote when he won his 2012 re-election:

>Barack Obama: We are more than just a collection of red states and blue states, we are the United States of America.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ElizabethHurley" title="Elizabeth Hurley (ElizabethHurley) on Twitter">[10]</a>

I think she likes him.

It's mostly speculation, but I'd call Hurley a quiet liberal.
