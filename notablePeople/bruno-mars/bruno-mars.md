Bruno Mars, whose real name is Peter Gene Hernandez, was born in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The total lack of information regarding Bruno Mars' religion and political beliefs is so staggering, that one speculates that Mars completely lacks depth and maybe even intelligence. Or, he just doesn't want people to know anything about him outside of his music career. He said:

>I'm not gonna preach that I'm a role model. I'm a fucking musician! But I've learned people are watching, so don't do nothing stupid.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mzpaparazzi242.com%2F2011%2F03%2Fscoop-bruno-mars-says-hes-a-fcking-musician-not-a-role-model%2F" title="Bruno Mars Says He&apos;s A F*cking Musician, Not A Role Model!!!">[1]</a>

Mars, as is indicated by his real last name, is of Hispanic descent and so probably has some Catholic in his family. The various question and answer sites on the Internet seem to agree that Mars is some kind of Christian.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.chacha.com%2Fquestion%2Fwhat-religion-does-bruno-mars-practice" title="What religion does Bruno Mars practice?">[2]</a> So we're going to go out on a limb and say he's, at least traditionally, a Catholic. 

The only clue to Mars' actual internal spirituality would be a line out of his song, "It Will Rain," where he sings:

>There's no religion that could save me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azlyrics.com%2Flyrics%2Fbrunomars%2Fitwillrain.html" title="Bruno Mars Lyrics – It Will Rain">[3]</a>

Not too religious, then.


## There aren't any politics on Mars

There isn't much for politics with Mr. Mars either. The best I could find was that he performed at a rainforest benefit concert at New York's Carnegie Hall.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rttnews.com%2F1856085%2Fjennifer-hudson-and-bruno-mars-perform-for-rainforest-fund.aspx" title="Jennifer Hudson And Bruno Mars Perform For Rainforest Fund">[4]</a> And Bill Clinton was there, too. So Mars is likely a liberal Democrat.
