John Wayne, whose real name is Marion Mitchell Morrison, was born in Winterset, Iowa but grew up in southern California near Los Angeles.

Wayne was raised a Presbyterian with a Scotch-Irish bloodline.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-srv%2Fstyle%2Flongterm%2Fbooks%2Fchap1%2Fwayne.htm" title="John Wayne: American.">[1]</a> One of his sons claims that he was not religious.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.traditio.com%2Ffeature%2Fwayne.htm" title="John Wayne&apos;s Catholic legacy.">[2]</a> But another says he would hand-write letters to God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholicnewsagency.com%2Fnews%2Fmy-granddaddy-john-wayne-actor-and-catholic-convert%2F" title="My &apos;granddaddy&apos; John Wayne, actor and Catholic convert.">[3]</a> Whether particularly religious or not, Wayne married three devout Catholic women in his life, and all seven of his children were raised Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fcatholicism.org%2Fjohn-wayne-im-a-cardiac-catholic.html" title="John Wayne &quot;I&apos;m a Cardiac-Catholic.">[4]</a>

He apparently converted to Catholicism a few days before his death.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholicnewsagency.com%2Fnews%2Fmy-granddaddy-john-wayne-actor-and-catholic-convert%2F" title="My &apos;granddaddy&apos; John Wayne, actor and Catholic convert.">[5]</a> He did not, however, convert to the Crystal Cathedral congregation after receiving a note from a girl with a broken leg, despite rumors.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.snopes.com%2Fglurge%2Fduke.asp" title="John Wayne Conversion.">[6]</a>

It's possible that this turn towards Catholicism on his deathbed had been a long time coming. After all, he was surrounded by Catholics his whole life–between his wives, children, the priests who were in and out of the house,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpw%2FJohn_Wayne.html" title="The religion of John Wayne, actor.">[7]</a> and his friends.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.traditio.com%2Ffeature%2Fwayne.htm" title="John Wayne&apos;s Catholic legacy.">[8]</a> Or he could have been a very sick man who was not terribly aware of what he was doing. In either case, it appears he was baptized,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.traditio.com%2Ffeature%2Fwayne.htm" title="John Wayne&apos;s Catholic legacy.">[9]</a> and so according to the Catholics, he won't be spending an eternity in hell.


## Everybody's favorite Republican

John Wayne was a committed conservative Republican, a role he was keen to discuss in public and play in his films. From his portrayals of the rugged individual in his westerns to the American commie-fighting hero in war films, Wayne acted on film what he idealized in real life.

His political views stemmed from his patriotic fervor:

>Sure I wave the American flag. Do you know a better flag to wave? Sure I love my country with all her faults. I'm not ashamed of that, never have been, never will be.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fquotes.lucywho.com%2Fjohn-wayne-quotes-t1271.html" title="John Wayne Quotes.">[10]</a>

He was attracted to the rugged individualism of nineteenth century America–a country where opportunity abounded if you were willing to pull yourself up by your bootstraps.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emanuellevy.com%2Fcomment%2Fjohn-waynes-politics-unabashed-yankee-doodle-9%2F" title="John Wayne&apos;s Politics: Unabashed Yankee Doodle.">[11]</a> But his was not a worldview that included food stamps and social security:

>I don't think a fella should be able to sit on his backside and receive welfare. I'd like to know why well-educated idiots keep apologizing for lazy and complaining people who think the world owes them a living.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FJohn_Wayne%23Politics" title="John Wayne.">[12]</a>

When anti-commie fever broke out after World War II, Wayne jumped right on the bandwagon. He was a founding member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FMotion_Picture_Alliance_for_the_Preservation_of_American_Ideals" title="Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals.">[13]</a> and also, for a time, a member of the controversial John Birch society.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-srv%2Fstyle%2Flongterm%2Fbooks%2Freviews%2Fwayne.htm" title="John Wayne, Man and Myth.">[14]</a> His fervent hatred of all things communist also led him to support the Vietnam War–which didn't win him any friends in Hollywood.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emanuellevy.com%2Fcomment%2Fjohn-wayne-the-vietnam-war-and-marlon-brando-1%2F" title="John Wayne, the Vietnam War and Marlon Brando.">[15]</a>

Not surprisingly, he was and is a favorite of the Republican party. He spoke at the Republican National Convention in 1968 during Nixon's first successful bid for the presidency.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emanuellevy.com%2Fcomment%2Fjohn-wayne-and-presidential-elections-5%2F" title="John Wayne and Presidential Elections.">[16]</a> And Republicans are still talking about him as the ideal representation of their party.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2011%2F06%2F27%2Fmichele-bachmann-john-wayne_n_885368.html" title="Michele Bachmann Flops &apos;John Wayne&apos; Reference In Waterloo, Iowa.">[17]</a>
