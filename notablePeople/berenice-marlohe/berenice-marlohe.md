Bérénice Marlohe was born and raised in Paris, France.

Marlohe might be a Catholic, but only because she's French. But her French-ness is diluted a bit by the fact that she's part Cambodian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2966102/bio" title="Bérénice Marlohe – Biography">[1]</a> so… Buddhist?

We're just taking wild shots in the dark here. The truth is, Marlohe is a newcomer to fame, and there is little to go on. However, it's clear that Marlohe feels that there's some sort of order to the universe. She has, more than once, spoken of "fate" as it applied to her being cast as a "Bond girl" in the 23rd installment of the James Bond series, Skyfall.

>Help yourself and the sky will help you. Everyone has the path of the divine, as long as you give yourself chances to go in the direction you want to go in.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/gq-girls/berenice-marlohe-skyfall-james-bond-girl-interview/page/3" title="Skyfall&apos;s heavenly body">[2]</a>

She recounts a dream she had in which she was Javier Bardem, her co-star in the film, six months prior to being cast, and she thought:

>Ah, another sign!' Sometimes life and the universe comes into line. The universe is cool!<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/gq-girls/berenice-marlohe-skyfall-james-bond-girl-interview" title="Skyfall&apos;s heavenly body">[3]</a>

Clearly, she subscribes to a kind of spiritualism, perhaps the occult, or maybe some belief in telekinesis. But as for some sort of conventional belief system, we're in the dark.


## La politique

Marlohe is equally vague when it comes to her political views. Only one small clue–and a potentially irrelevant one at that–indicates a potential conservative worldview. Marlohe is a gun owner, though it seems to be primarily for her career as an actress. She feels she'll have to practice looking good with a gun in her hand. She even owns an assault rifle. She said:

>[It] is a really big one. Yes, you know, one of the very big ones. That was my third gun.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/girls/gq-girls/berenice-marlohe-skyfall-james-bond-girl-interview/page/2" title="Skyfall&apos;s heavenly body">[4]</a>

You might be tempted to say something along the lines of: 'She's not American, gun enthusiasm doesn't equal a conservative viewpoint outside of the states.'

Well, in western Europe, it certainly does.
