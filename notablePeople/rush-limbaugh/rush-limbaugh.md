Rush Limbaugh was born in Cape Girardeau, Missouri.

Limbaugh was raised and considers himself a Methodist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pl/Rush_Limbaugh.html" title="The religion of Rush Limbaugh, talk radio host">[1]</a>

Limbaugh considers himself a spokesperson for America's religious right, evangelizing the merits of "conservative, family values," even though he has no children and has been married four times.<a class="source-citation" href="http://madmikesamerica.com/2012/03/rush-limbaugh-foreign-traveler-and-amateur-pharmacist/" title="Rush Limbaugh, foreign traveler and amateur pharmacist">[2]</a> He preaches the dangers of drug use, even though he's an addict himself.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-1561324.html" title="Rush Limbaugh Arrested on Drug Charges">[3]</a> And among Rush's most recent controversies, he publicly called fellow Methodist Sandra Fluke a "slut" and a "prostitute" and asked her to post videos of herself having sex online because she had the gall to ask that contraception be covered under her student insurance plan.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.umportal.org/article.asp?id=8721" title="UM student reacts to Limbaugh comment">[4]</a>

In fact, for his disparaging comments towards this student, factions of the Methodist Church condemned Limbaugh, officially releasing a statement that read, among other things:

>Attempting to silence women through humiliation is an affront to God in Whose image we are all made.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.unyumc.org/news/detail/1025" title="COSROW condemns Rush Limbaugh Limbaugh">[5]</a>

Though for all of his hypocrisy, at least Rush is humble. He says things like:

>Greetings, conversationalists across the fruited plain, this is Rush Limbaugh, the most dangerous man in America, with the largest hypothalamus in North America, serving humanity simply by opening my mouth, destined for my own wing in the Museum of Broadcasting, executing everything I do flawlessly with zero mistakes, doing this show with half my brain tied behind my back just to make it fair because I have talent on loan from……God. Rush Limbaugh. A man. A legend. A way of life.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh" title="Rush Limbaugh">[6]</a>

## A shining example of right-wing nut-jobbery

Limbaugh is a Republican, a conservative Republican. He's so conservative that he thinks Republican moderates like John McCain need to join the Independent Party or even side with the Democrats because, in Rush's view, there's no room for moderates in the Republican Party.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2008/11/06/get_off_the_ledge_conservatives_we_have_two_battles_on_our_hands" title="Get Off the Ledge, Conservatives! We Have Two Battles on Our Hands">[7]</a>

Limbaugh can be, at times, rather racist. His list of racist comments is long and picking one choice quote was quite difficult, but here it is. Follow the [link](http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/limbaugh.asp) for a few more.

>I mean, let's face it, we didn't have slavery in this country for over 100 years because it was a bad thing. Quite the opposite: slavery built the South. I'm not saying we should bring it back; I'm just saying it had its merits. For one thing, the streets were safer after dark.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.snopes.com/politics/quotes/limbaugh.asp" title="Rush Limbaugh &apos;Racist Quotes&apos; List">[8]</a>

Furthermore, some might consider him sexist as well. He said:

>[Feminism was established] to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.<a class="source-citation" href="http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200508160001" title="The &quot;Truth&quot; according to Limbaugh: Feminism was established &quot;to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.&quot;">[9]</a>

Limbaugh is endlessly critical of the Obama administration (some of which might be racism). When Obama was elected, Rush said:

>I hope he fails.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2009/01/16/limbaugh_i_hope_obama_fails" title="Limbaugh: I Hope Obama Fails">[10]</a>

Limbaugh has millions of loyal listeners, many of which take his word as socio-political gospel. Many supporters, when confronted with critiques of Rush's views, claim that it's all for the sake of entertainment–that his arrogance is a front, and that his controversial views serve only to boost ratings. Personally, I don't completely buy it. But if this is true, the humor is in bad form and those scores of listeners who take Rush quite seriously, to whom Rush owes his fortune and fame, are being misled.
