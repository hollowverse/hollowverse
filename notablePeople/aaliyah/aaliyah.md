Aaliyah, whose last name was Haughton, was born in Brooklyn, New York and raised mostly in Detroit, Michigan. She died in a plane crash in 2001 at the age of 22.

Aaliyah was Roman Catholic: she attended a Catholic school growing up,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/singer-aaliyah-was-talented" title="Singer Aaliyah was talented.">[1]</a> went to church,<a class="source-citation" href="http://aaliyah1inamillon.tripod.com/aaliyah/id10.html" title="Magazine&apos;s Tribute To Her.">[2]</a> and she credited God with giving her talent.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop2/with-love-to-aaliyah/aaliyah-interviews.html" title="AALIYAH&apos;S INTERVIEWS.">[3]</a>

She also turned to God for guidance during her short career:

>I meditate a lot and try to think good thoughts all the time. I like to remember that God is in my heart and leading me the way through any setbacks I might have and at the same time giving me guidance in my career.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.angelfire.com/hiphop2/with-love-to-aaliyah/aaliyah-interviews.html" title="AALIYAH&apos;S INTERVIEWS.">[4]</a>

As would be expected, her funeral took place at a Roman Catholic church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2001-08-31/entertainment/aaliyah.service_1_aaliyah-plane-crash-funeral?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ" title="Aaliyah funeral attracts fans, stars.">[5]</a>

## Gender Politics

We don't know a lot about Aaliyah's political beliefs. She performed at a White House Christmas celebration in 1998 for Bill and Hillary Clinton, and she had nice things to say about the President:

>[I]t was really great to perform for [President Clinton] because he really loves music. And you can see the passion in his eyes as he's watching you.<a class="source-citation" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=7RwozQ2Z5XgC&pg=PA79&lpg=PA79&dq=aaliyah+white+house&source=bl&ots=sFEUtmtBva&sig=HS7c_iR2r4zcJZw4Mo2cP1u_Zcg&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Dd5tUM6UAensigKLu4HoBg&ved=0CF8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&q=aaliyah%20white%20house&f=false" title="Aaliyah Remembered – William Sutherland.">[6]</a>

That's hardly an endorsement of the Democratic party, but we know she didn't hate the guy at least.

Her unique style could be seen as something of a statement on women's rights–or at least a woman's image. Aaliyah often wore baggy pants instead of glamorous dresses in her videos, making her look more like a street thug than an R&B sex symbol.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2011/08/the-gender-politics-of-aaliyah/" title="The Gender Politics of Aaliyah.">[7]</a> Not that she didn't spend plenty of time looking womanly and sexy, she just didn't think her sexuality should define her as a performer.

>I don't wear things that are ridiculously short or low cut. I feel that your talent should do the talking not a revealing outfit.<a class="source-citation" href="http://aaliyah1inamillon.tripod.com/aaliyah/id10.html" title="Magazine&apos;s Tribute To Her.">[8]</a>

Aaliyah's nontraditional attire not only influenced other women artists who came after her, but it was affirming for "young urban girls" who had a role model in the singer–someone who dressed like them instead of like Hollywood.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.clutchmagonline.com/2011/08/the-gender-politics-of-aaliyah/" title="The Gender Politics of Aaliyah.">[9]</a>
