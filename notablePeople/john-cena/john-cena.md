Cena doesn't speak often about his religion or political views, but he lists himself as Catholic on his Myspace page.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.myspace.com/chaingang_leader_cena" title="John Cena (John Cena)">[1]</a>

Politically, Cena has endorsed Republican Connecticut Senate candidate Linda McMahon<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wn.com/John_Cena_On_Linda_McMahon%27s_Senate_Campaign" title="John Cena On Linda McMahon&apos;s Senate Campaign">[2]</a> and advocated for the deportation of Obama's auntâ€“who is allegedly in the U.S. illegally.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.wrestlezone.com/news/196189-john-cena-on-barack-obama-politics-if-wrestling-is-real" title="John Cena On Barack Obama, Politics, If Wrestling Is Real">[3]</a> So, he's probably a Republican.
