Kendall Jenner was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

Jenner appears to be a Christian just like the rest of her famous family. She didn't go to Catholic school like her Kardashian half-sisters,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.posh24.com/hot_news/kylie_and_kendall_jenner_are_skipping_school_to_become_famous" title="Kylie And Kendall Jenner Are Skipping School To Become Famous!.">[1]</a> but she goes to the church her family helped establish and currently supports.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.zimbio.com/photos/Kendall+Jenner/Kardashian+Family+Leaving+Church+Easter+Sunday/rzjOLaWLimM" title="The Kardashian Family Leaving Church On Easter Sunday.">[2]</a>

Jenner's godmother, Kathie Lee Gifford says the young socialite talks about her faith a lot.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.patheos.com/blogs/faithgoespop/2012/09/a-kardashian-kult-is-more-realistic-than-you-think/" title="A Kardashian Kult Is More Realistic Than You Think.">[3]</a> And when talking about KhloÃ© Kardashian's struggles with fertility, she said,

>God has a plan; something will happen soon enough.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a405818/kendall-jenner-talks-khloe-kardashian-fertility-god-has-a-plan.html" title="Kendall Jenner talks Khloe Kardashian fertility: &apos;God has a plan.&apos;">[4]</a>

It looks like she's pretty confident that God's plan is going to work out for family. And why wouldn't it? It seems to have worked out pretty well so far.


## Politically safe

About Jenner's politics I could find exactly nothing. It's safe to say this girl might have some growing up to do before she gets too involved in her country's political process.

We know that conservative TV station Fox News plays regularly in the Kardashian/Jenner household, but half-sister Kim Kardashian says that all the kids are Democrats.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.politico.com/blogs/click/2012/04/kim-kardashian-on-running-for-mayor-stay-tuned-121938.html" title="Kim Kardashian, Democrat, on running for mayor: &apos;Stay tuned.&apos;">[5]</a> She didn't say for sure whether than included her half-siblings, but I think it's reasonable to assume.

Jenner does seem to have a desire to do some good with her silver-spooned position. She showed her support in charity events for multiple sclerosis<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2146711/Kylie-Kendall-Jenner-parade-pins-snakeskin-metallic-jeans-charity-event.html" title="Kylie and Kendall Jenner parade their pins in snakeskin and metallic jeans at a charity event.">[6]</a> and childhood leukemia.<a class="source-citation" href="http://act.mtv.com/posts/sweet-tweet-kendall-jenner-boy-leukemia/" title="Sweet Tweet: Kendall Jenner Rallies Twitter To Help Young Boy With Leukemia.">[7]</a> And she asked everyone invited to her sweet sixteen party to bring a toy for a children's hospital in lieu of one for herself.<a class="source-citation" href="http://blog.starcam.com/post/Kendall-Jenner-Turns-Down-Big-Birthday-Bash-Makes-it-Charitable-Event-Instead.aspx" title="Kendall Jenner Turns Down Big Birthday Bash, Makes it Charitable Event Instead.">[8]</a>

Who knows, maybe in the future we'll see her throw some money at causes that aren't so politically safe.
