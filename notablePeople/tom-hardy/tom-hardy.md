Tom Hardy was born and raised in London, England.

Hardy is a strange mix of Catholic and. . . not Catholic. He has a rather large tattoo of the Virgin Mary on his left arm,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://crushable.com/entertainment/a-guide-to-tom-hardys-tattoos-551/gallery-page/2/" title="A Guide to Tom Hardy&apos;s Tattoos.">[1]</a> which would make you think he is–or was–a devout Catholic. And I saw at least one picture of him wearing a crucifix around his neck.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.flickr.com/photos/vanessalua/4935787886/" title="Tom Hardy.">[2]</a>

But in one interview, with a laugh, he played down his devotion to the faith of his childhood:

>My mother comes from an Irish family of eight–she's Catholic and I'm not, so she's going into hell and I'm going into limbo.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.tomhardyparty.com/hardy-perennial/" title="Tom Hardy Party!">[3]</a>

How's that for irony? So it's tough to say exactly where Hardy stands. He doesn't talk about it all that much, so this is pretty much all we have to go on. Maybe we can call him a sometimes Catholic for now.

I could find almost nothing about Hardy's political views. It's possible that he's socially liberal since he seems to be liberal with his sexuality. He said that although relationships with men aren't his thing anymore, he's experimented with men in the past. When asked if he had had sex with a man he said,

>Of course I have. I'm an actor for fuck's sake. I've played with everything and everyone. I love the form and the physicality, but now that I'm in my thirties, it doesn't do it for me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/28/inception-star-tom-hardy_n_662907.html" title="&apos;Inception&apos; Star Tom Hardy: I&apos;m An Actor, Of Course I&apos;ve Had Gay Sex.">[4]</a>

Obviously one's sexual orientation does not automatically put one in the liberal category, but that's the only stereotype I've got to go on with this one so I went with it. If you can give us any more clues, please let us know in the comments!
