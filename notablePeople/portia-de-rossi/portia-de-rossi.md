Portia Lee James DeGeneres, known professionally as Portia de Rossi and born Amanda Lee Rogers, was born in Horsham, Victoria, Australia and was raised outside Melbourne in Geelong, Victoria.

One can only assume that de Rossi is non-religious. I couldn't find a shred of information on her religious upbringing or her current views on religion or spirituality. Not a thing.

Melbourne isn't a particularly religious place, with over 20% of the population claiming to adhere to no religion,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.living-in-melbourne.com/religion-in-melbourne.html" title="Religion in Melbourne Australia.">[1]</a> and I'm guessing her family joined that crowd. On top of that, de Rossi's wife Ellen DeGeneres, is in the non-religious, albeit spiritual, category. Maybe they share some views? But we're just speculating here.

If you find anything on de Rossi's spiritual outlook, let us know in the comments. Otherwise, we'll assume non-religious.


## The Politics of Sexuality

It doesn't appear that de Rossi is interested in engaging in partisan politics–she doesn't talk about Obama or any other politicians and she doesn't engage in any issues either. Except one: gay marriage.

After the California Supreme Court legalized gay marriage in the state in 2008, de Rossi married her partner, Ellen DeGeneres. And although their marriage remains legal, the opportunity for other gay couples to follow suit was again made illegal later that year with the passage of Proposition 8. About the law, de Rossi said,

>[Proposition 8] takes away people's right to have what everybody in this country should have. Because it's really not a religious issue or moral issue, it's just simply a civil rights issue. And the fact that the majority can get to vote on the rights of a minority seems very un-American to me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZnpFqBbyIo" title="The View – Portia De Rossi.">[2]</a>

And she's not impressed with Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard's view on the issue either. De Rossi, who became an American citizen in 2011,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2011/09/16/portia_de_rossi_becomes_an_american_ci" title="Portia De Rossi Becomes An American Citizen.">[3]</a> said about her home country,

>I always thought Australia would pass this equal rights law long before America would, and I'm a little bit disappointed with the new Prime Minister.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/11/18/3070015.htm" title="De Rossi disappointed by Gillard&apos;s gay marriage stance.">[4]</a>

In the slightly less partisan category, she has also spoken out against the ultra-thin female body image promoted by Hollywood and the modeling industry in light of her own past struggle with anorexia.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2010/11/18/3070015.htm" title="De Rossi disappointed by Gillard&apos;s gay marriage stance.">[5]</a>

Without anything else to go on, it seems that de Rossi is socially liberal, and so we'll tentatively put her in the liberal category for now. Again, if you know anything else, keep us updated in the comments.
