Lance Armstrong, whose name at birth was Lance Gunderson, was born and raised in Plano, Texas.

There is no word that I can find regarding Armstrong's childhood religion, if there was any. But it is widely accepted that Armstrong is an agnostic or even an atheist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nndb.com/people/702/000030612/" title="Lance Armstrong">[1]</a> But I'm not sure it's that simple. Perhaps the quote that most supports that view (and it might be Armstrong's funniest as well) is:

>If there was a God, I'd still have both nuts.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://atheism.about.com/b/2005/08/08/lance-armstrong-and-god.htm" title="Lance Armstrong and God">[2]</a>

And while Armstrong overtly rejects organized religion, he doesn't disparage its possible usefulness, saying:

>I had developed a certain distrust of organized religion growing up, but I felt I had the capacity to be a spiritual person, and to hold some fervent beliefs.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.goodreads.com/quotes/270897-i-asked-myself-what-i-believed-i-had-never-prayed" title="Quote by Lance Armstrong">[3]</a>

And he acknowledges there might be a God in heaven, but he isn't willing to go so far as to live a life solely motivated by that possibility:

>If there was indeed a God at the end of my days, I hoped he didn't say, 'But you were never a Christian, so you're going the other way from heaven.' If so, I was going to reply, 'You know what? You're right. Fine.'<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Lance_Armstrong" title="Lance Armstrong">[4]</a>

However, it is evident that Armstrong is not religious and does not see religion as something worth too much of his time or energy–despite a battle with cancer, something many feel will bring even the staunchest unbeliever to religion.


## Political ambiguity

Much like his religious views, Armstrong's political views are equally difficult to define. There seems to be a consensus among opinionated question and answer site contributors that Armstrong is a Democrat, and slightly liberal. One commenter said:

>Mr. Armstrong has described himself as "middle to left." He's pro-choice, "not keen on guns," against the Iraq war, and for separation of church and state. By standards of his home state of Texas, he would be considered a Democrat.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_Lance_Armstrong_a_Democrat_or_Republican" title="Is Lance Armstrong a Democrat or Republican">[5]</a>

Now, numerous sites echo this answer, despite its more-than questionable credibility.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.chacha.com/question/is-lance-armstrong-a-democrat" title="Is lance armstrong a democrat?">[6]</a>

One thing for sure is that Armstrong is pretty good friends with George W. Bush, though he said they disagreed about the Iraq War. Armstrong said:

>He's a personal friend, but we've all got the right not to agree with our friends.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jul/06/france.sport" title="Serena got the message, now it&apos;s Lance&apos;s turn as French cheers become jeers for US stars">[7]</a>

Armstrong did briefly run for governor of Texas–supposedly as a Democrat, because the bulk of his platform was how incumbent Republican governor Rick Perry was an idiot. He said:

>Rick Perry has made Texas the laughing stock of America, with his rants and raves against the Health Care Reform Act, and his threats of secession.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://74.208.199.156/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1585:lance-governor&catid=14:first-person-stories&Itemid=200006" title="Breaking News: Armstrong to Run for Governor of Texas">[8]</a>

Armstrong quickly dropped out of the race, saying he wanted to spend time with his family.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://news.lalate.com/category/lance-armstrong/" title="Lance Armstrong">[9]</a> But there's nothing conclusive I can find that Armstrong was explicitly a Democrat–though it seems reasonable to assume so.
