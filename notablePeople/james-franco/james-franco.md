James Franco was born and raised in Palo Alto, California.

Franco's upbringing was largely non-religious. It has been described as "academic, liberal and largely secular."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/24/james-franco-interview-milk" title="Amy Raphael interviews James Franco">[1]</a> But Judaism runs deep in Franco, though only on his mother's side. His grandmother was, at one time, a member of the National Council of Jewish Women,<a class="source-citation" href="http://prabandhasree.blogspot.com/2012/02/biography-for-james-franco.html" title="Biography for James Franco">[2]</a> an oft-described feminist organization dedicated to social justice for Jews and women.

However, Franco seems to regret his secular upbringing, saying:

>I do feel like I missed out on the Jewish experience. My Jewish friends tell me not to worry… but I like the idea of religion as a source of community.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/24/james-franco-interview-milk" title="Amy Raphael interviews James Franco">[3]</a>

Regarding his own spiritual views, Franco is vague and expresses a sort of agnosticism, but a light agnosticism, one that probably believes in God in some form or another. Really, he's just unsure. He said when asked if he is a believer:

>In God? I don't know. Yes. To a certain extent. It's a complicated question.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2009/jan/24/james-franco-interview-milk" title="Amy Raphael interviews James Franco">[4]</a>

## Freaks and Geeks–sounds like politics

Franco has not explicitly made any political statements, endorsements, or taken any political positions that I can find. If you've got something, let me know in the comments.

But it seems reasonable to assume that Franco's a liberal. First of all, his upbringing was "academic, liberal, and largely secular." Second of all, he's buddy-buddy enough with Obama to have taken career advice from him. Apparently, Franco asked the president how he dealt with criticism. Obama responded: "Humor, basically."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/858194-james-franco-barack-obama-gave-me-advice" title="James Franco: Barack Obama gave me advice">[5]</a> The advice inspired Franco to make this [video](http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/ab25302c8e/james-franco-s-rejected-ucla-commencement-speech), where he alludes to long-running jokes about him in the media.

Then, if you start analyzing the films Franco has done, it seems pretty far-left. He played a weed-crazy stoner in Pineapple Express and in three films, he's played a gay man. When critics started asking if Franco was perhaps himself gay, he responded with this:

>It's funny because the way that kind of stuff is talked about on blogs is so black-and-white. It's all cut-and-dry identity politics… Part of what I'm interested in is how these people who were living anti-normative lifestyles contended with opposition. Or, you know what, maybe I'm just gay.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thefrisky.com/2011-01-06/james-franco-maybe-im-gay/" title="James Franco: &quot;Maybe I&apos;m Gay.">[6]</a>

Either way, Franco seems to have no problems with gay people. So, I guess he's a liberal?
