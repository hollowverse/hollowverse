JoJo, whose full name is Joanna Noëlle Blagden Levesque, was born in Brattleboro, Vermont. She grew up in Keene, New Hampshire and Foxborough, Massachusetts.

She was raised by her Catholic mother, and was influenced by the music of the Catholic church,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.combustiblecelluloid.com/interviews/jojo.shtml" title="Interview with JoJo.">[1]</a> though she doesn't appear to be particularly religious now. She almost mentioned God once, but not quite:

>I feel so blessed, like someone is looking over my shoulder.<a class="source-citation" href="http://web.poptower.com/joanna-jojo-levesque.htm" title="jojo.">[2]</a>

Someone, huh? Hopefully she doesn't mean that creepy guy she saw checking her out the other day. More likely, it's some higher being she's talking about.

A song on her second album is called, "Note to God." It's predictably about ending wars, filling the world with love, that sort of thing.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/jojo/notetogod.html" title="&quot;Note to God.&quot;">[3]</a> Even though JoJo didn't write it,<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_High_Road" title="The High Road.">[4]</a> she apparently felt comfortable enough with the subject to put it on her album. So even if she's not terribly Christian, she probably believes in God.

She doesn't seem to believe in all the tenets of the Catholic church though. JoJo showed her support for the LBGT community by performing at the 2012 Miami Beach Gay Pride Parade.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.justjaredjr.com/2012/04/18/jojo-miami-beach-gay-pride-parade/" title="JoJo: Miami Beach Gay Pride Parade!.">[5]</a> We can guess that she's probably liberal if she's supporting gay rights, but that's about it from JoJo politically. My guess is that we might see more from this young woman as she gets older.
