Michael Clarke Duncan was born and raised in Chicago, Illinois. He died in 2012 at the age of 54 of complications from a heart attack.

I couldn't find much about Duncan's own religious beliefs aside from this quote about Hollywood and being thankful to God:

>Whatever God gave you, you have to work that to your best ability–especially out here in Hollywood, the land of beautiful people.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/m/michael_clarke_duncan.html" title="Michael Clarke Duncan Quotes.">[1]</a>

But he sure seemed to surround himself with a lot of Baptists. In fact, his fiancée at the time of his death had been ordained a Baptist minister while the two were together.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.examiner.com/article/michael-clarke-duncan-and-omarosa-manigault-engaged-at-time-of-his-death" title="Michael Clarke Duncan and Omarosa Manigault engaged at time of his death.">[2]</a> His funeral services were held at a Pentecostal church, but by another Baptist minister.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://hiphollywood.com/2012/09/funeral-services-for-michael-clarke-duncan-announced/" title="Funeral Services For Michael Clarke Duncan Announced.">[3]</a>

He might not have been very vocal about his faith, or maybe the subject of his death has pushed those interviews into the background, but I'm going to guess he was a fairly devout man. Aside from his obvious connections to the church, he also wore a cross around his neck–fairly frequently, as far as I could tell.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2200873/Michael-Clarke-Duncan-Fans-pay-tribute-late-actor-public-viewing-casket--followed-screening-The-Green-Mile.html" title="Michael Clarke Duncan: Fans pay tribute to late actor during public viewing of casket… followed by a screening of The Green Mile.">[4]</a>

So, sadly without much information, I'm going to call Michael Clarke Duncan a Baptist unless one of you diligent readers can point me in another direction.


## Duncan, the gay virgin

I wasn't able to find much information on Duncan's political beliefs either, but I have enough clues to make me believe he was most likely a Democrat. First of all, aside from being a Baptist minister, Omarosa Manigault, his fiancée before his death, used to be a political analyst for former Vice President Al Gore.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1083768,00.html" title="The Surreal Life&apos;s Omarosa.">[5]</a> And he definitely admired her political knowledge. He said,

>She's very knowledgeable. She's the first woman that I can wake up next to and knows all about politics and what's going on in the world. The world, defense, what's going on with the President's program. Anything and everything. She's very intelligent.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/omarosa-michael-clarke-duncan-engaged-wedding-wed_n_1854058.html" title="Omarosa Speaks After Michael Clarke Duncan Death; Couple&apos;s Secret Engagement Revealed.">[6]</a>

And [this little video](http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2012/09/04/watch-michael-clarke-duncan-and-his-gay-connections) seems to go along with the whole liberal theme. In it his character, a gay virgin, gets hit on by another man and he claims he's saving himself for the right man.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2012/09/04/watch-michael-clarke-duncan-and-his-gay-connections" title="WATCH Michael Clarke Duncan and His Gay Connections.">[7]</a> So, presumably, he's a supporter of the gay rights movement.

That's all I have, but again, I think it's enough to call him a liberal Democrat for now. If you have any information on Michael Clarke Duncan that I missed, please let us know in the comments.
