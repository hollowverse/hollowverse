Ashley Benson was born and raised in Anaheim Hills, California.

Benson is a Christian, and appears to be rather devout, although I have no clue on a denomination. Several sites claim she attended a 2,500-member church,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://ashley-benson.org/ashley/" title="Ashley.">[1]</a> so maybe she comes from mega-church, evangelical ilk. Or maybe all these sites are just regurgitating some bad (unsourced) information from her [Wikipedia page](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ashley_Benson).

Regardless of all that, from what we know of her Twitter feed, she's a pretty serious Christian. First, like so many tweeters, she sends out prayers for the victims of national tragedies.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/AshBenzo/status/279660928763568128" title="AshBenzo: Love and prayers go out to …">[2]</a> Then she's been known to retweet scripture when the mood takes her.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tweetwood.com/AshBenzo/tweet/242065924432203779" title="Ashley Benson tweets.">[3]</a> And finally, she posted this:

>God is good.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/AshBenzo/status/85223747962937344" title="AshBenzo: God is good.">[4]</a>

Simple enough, and certainly telling.


## Pretty Little Guns

Benson appears to be a fan of the political process. She votes and she wants you to vote. She posted this on her Twitter feed on election day, 2012:

>Don't forget to exercise your right & VOTE today. Be heard! Find your polling place here: http://ashbenson.me/184ct3<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/AshBenzo/status/265924620593545216" title="AshBenzo: Don&apos;t forget to exercise your …">[5]</a>

She did not, however, endorse any candidate or political party.

The only partisan thing I found from Benson implies that she's liberal, but not necessarily a Democrat. She retweeted a poster which states, "Last year, handguns killed. . ." and then lists several first-world countries, none of whose deaths exceed double digits. The last one is the U.S., which lists 10,728 handgun-related deaths.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tweetwood.com/photos/AshBenzo/454353/ashley_benson" title="Photo by Ashley Benson on Twitter.">[6]</a> The tweet was in response to the tragic elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012.

Assuming her views on gun control are a reflection of her views on other issues, we'll call her a liberal. But if you have any tips for us on either her religious or political affiliations, please let us know in the comments.
