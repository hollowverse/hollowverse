Neil Armstrong was born in Wapakoneta, Ohio. His family moved much throughout Ohio as a result of his father's job, though they ultimately settled back in Wapakoneta when Armstrong was 14-years-old. He died in 2012 in Cincinnati, Ohio from complications associated with heart surgery.

Armstrong grew up in a devout religious family, though I can't find which denomination they adhered to. Regardless, Armstrong reported that they did not force their beliefs on him, rather:

>They allowed me to pursue my own interests. They didn't try to dictate to me what I should do or where I should go.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fobituaries%2Fscience-obituaries%2F9499820%2FNeil-Armstrong.html" title="Neil Armstrong">[1]</a>

Armstrong's actual religious views are immersed in rumor and conspiracy–much like his famous moon landing. Christians claim Armstrong was a wildly devout Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fchristiandiarist.com%2F2012%2F08%2F26%2Fneil-armstrong-a-great-american-a-devout-christian%2F" title="Neil Armstrong: A Great American, A Devout Christian">[2]</a> atheists have claimed him as one of their own<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fblog.aarp.org%2F2012%2F08%2F25%2Fneil-armstrong-first-man-moon-apollo-11%2F" title="Neil Armstrong: 5 Fun Facts About the First Man to Walk On The Moon">[3]</a> and some Muslims claim that, while on the moon, Armstrong heard the Ezan (the Muslim call to prayer) and converted to Islam.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fdeaconsbench%2F2012%2F08%2Fneil-armstrong-muslim%2F" title="Neil Armstrong, Muslim?">[4]</a>

Well, let's have a look at the evidence.

When Armstrong applied for a position at NASA, he marked his religious views on the paperwork as "no religious preference."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fblog.aarp.org%2F2012%2F08%2F25%2Fneil-armstrong-first-man-moon-apollo-11%2F" title="Neil Armstrong: 5 Fun Facts About the First Man to Walk On The Moon">[5]</a> During the first moon landing, Buzz Aldrin, Armstrong's space-travel companion and a devout Presbyterian, held a communion ceremony (a Christian ritual) and reported that Armstrong didn't participate but rather watched quietly and respectfully.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fcommentisfree%2Fbelief%2F2012%2Fsep%2F13%2Fbuzz-aldrin-communion-moon" title="How Buzz Aldrin&apos;s communion on the moon was hushed up">[6]</a> And here's the smoking gun, folks:

Aldrin was a lifelong Boy Scout. He loved the Boy Scouts. In the late-1950s, Armstrong decided he wanted to lead a Boy Scout troop, so he went to sign up at a Methodist Church. The paperwork asked the applicant what their religious beliefs were, Armstrong wrote in "Deist."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Feyeonfaith.blogspot.com%2F2012%2F08%2Fneil-armstrong-religion-secondary-to.html" title="Neil Armstrong: Religion secondary to faith">[7]</a> So there you have it Christians, Atheists and Muslims: none of the above.


## Politics? No Thanks

Armstrong is considered an American hero. His moonwalk had political motives, of course. It was a show of American scientific, engineering, computing and financial superiority during the Cold War–a message to the Soviets, if you will. Furthermore, it was a part of a trend during the '60s of U.S. government expansion and a nationalistic morale-booster for the American people.

Despite the fame and notoriety Armstrong enjoyed after his space mission, he was widely considered a humble, quiet man who didn't see the point in capitalizing on his achievements.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.csmonitor.com%2FCommentary%2Fthe-monitors-view%2F2012%2F0827%2FNeil-Armstrong-A-giant-leap-for-modesty" title="Neil Armstrong: A giant leap for modesty">[8]</a> Armstrong was approached by political organizations of all stripes, but he refused their advances and never went in to politics, though many of his contemporaries did.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbatterys.multiply.com%2Fjournal%3F%26show_interstitial%3D1%26u%3D%252Fjournal" title="Bob&apos;s Blog">[9]</a>

If anyone could drag his political views out of him, Armstrong seemed to favor a small government approach, something possibly akin to libertarianism. He was unhappy that America seemed to consider itself the "world's police" and spoke of the importance of state's rights.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpalmettopublicrecord.org%2F2012%2F08%2F27%2Fwhat-less-government-will-buy-you-neil-armstrongs-eyebrow-raising-appearance-at-the-gop-convention%2F" title="What less government will buy you: Neil Armstrong&apos;s eyebrow-raising appearance at the GOP convention">[10]</a>
