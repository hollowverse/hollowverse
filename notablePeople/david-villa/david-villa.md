David Villa was born and raised in Tuilla, Spain.

He hasn't spoken about his personal religious views, but given that he's a Spaniard, it's highly likely that he, or at least his family, has something to do with the Catholic tradition.

There's a chance Villa is a bit intolerant of at least one religion. Villa was party to an international controversy when, during a game, Villa and opponent Mesut Ozil got into a brawl. Ozil said of the incident:

>I did this because I was defending my religion because David Villa insulted Islam.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.allvoices.com/contributed-news/10028659-did-david-villa-insulted-mesut-ozils-islam-religion-at-super-cup-brawl" title="Did David Villa insulted Mesut Ozil&apos;s Islam religion at Super Cup brawl?">[1]</a>

Unfortunately, that seems to be the extent of Villa's public commentary on religion.


## Son of a miner's politics

Villa's politics are relatively minimal as well. He has sided with "labor" in the seemingly endless austerity strikes plaguing Spain. Villa's father was a miner<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.davidvilla7.es/en/biography/" title="David Villa Official Website: Biography.">[2]</a> and when coal miners marched in Madrid–fearing for their jobs–Villa expressed his support.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.totalbarca.com/2012/news/villa-supports-spanish-miners/" title="Villa supports Spanish miners">[3]</a>

Other than that, no official political stances from the Villa camp that I can find. Let us know if anything changes.
