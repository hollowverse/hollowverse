Lucy Lawless, born Lucille Frances Ryan, was born and raised in Mount Albert, New Zealand.

Lawless is the descendent of an Irish criminal, sent to New Zealand to serve out a criminal sentence.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tv.yahoo.com/news/zachary-quinto-lucy-lawless-irish-tv-actors-never-20110307-184000-257.html" title="Zachary Quinto, Lucy Lawless and Other TV Actors with Unexpected Irish Roots">[1]</a> Apparently, her ancestor kept the faith because Lawless was raised a Catholic. She said:

>I have five brothers and one sister. We're this big, sprawling Irish Catholic family. I don't live that far from any of them.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lucylawless.net/lucy.php#Biography" title="AUSXIP Lucy Lawless">[2]</a>

Throughout her acting career, the morality and guilt inherent in the Catholic religion would rise up and strike her. For example, she expressed feeling strange about acting out a "horror/lesbian vampire" scene during the filming of her show Xena: Warrior Princess. She said:

>That was a weird one. I grew up Catholic and so we thought we had the edge over vampires because there was always a crucifix handy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://metro.co.uk/2007/05/29/60-seconds-lucy-lawless-394067/" title="60 Seconds: Lucy Lawless">[3]</a>

However, something interesting popped up during the research of Lawless' article. She said in response to a question about reviving her singing career by participating on the TV show, Celebrity Duets:

>It lit a fire under my belly. I'd kind of lost my religion, acting and everything. So when the possibility of singing with Smokey Robinson [on Celebrity Duets] came up, I just leaped at it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lucylawless.net/articles/2007/outlook/index.html" title="Xena to Diva Lucy Gets Vocal">[4]</a>

Lost her religion? There's a story there. Unfortunately, she didn't elaborate during the interview, but I think it's safe to say she's a lapsed Catholic.


## Going the political distance

Lawless is majorly political. Just look at her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/RealLucyLawless). It's an endless stream of factoids, calls to arms and appeals to politicians. She's a political activist, putting herself in danger and on the front lines against corporatocracy and planetary disintegration.

In 2012, Lawless and a group of activists boarded an oil exploration ship as it was docked in a New Zealand port out of protest, spent over three days on the vessel, and was ultimately arrested and charged with burglary. She ended up pleading guilty to criminal trespassing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tv.yahoo.com/news/actress-lucy-lawless-pleads-guilty-trespass-233602397.html" title="Actress Lucy Lawless pleads guilty to trespass">[5]</a>

She wrote a [political manifesto](http://good.net.nz/magazine/7/good-start/lucy-lawless) of sorts, outlining her political views. They are quite liberal. She said that she chose not to become a U.S. citizen because she didn't like the Bush administration, that Obama "inherited… a monstrous snowball of problems," and discussed her family's green lifestyle including their beehives and compost piles, and said:

>I remember a gasoline company that posted a $6 billion profit in the wake of the first Iraq War. I thought, What are you going to do with that, buy a new planet? There's no planet B.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://good.net.nz/magazine/7/good-start/lucy-lawless" title="Lucy Lawless">[6]</a>

Her liberal views also extend to gay marriage. She vocally opposed California's Prop 8 when it was a raging debate in 2008. Plus, she made some waves in the gay community when she announced after Xena ended that she thought her character was a lesbian.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0005128/bio" title="Lucy Lawless – Biography">[7]</a>

The political issues that are important to Lawless are clearly central in her life. This princess is quite the warrior.
