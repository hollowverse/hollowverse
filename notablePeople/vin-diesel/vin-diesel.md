Vin Diesel, whose real name is Mark Sinclair Vincent, was born and raised in Manhattan, New York.

There is exactly nothing about Vin Diesel's religion. Considering that he grew up in New York City and he is half-black and half-white it would be impossible to even make conjectures about his religious background or upbringing.

However, considering that his mother is an astrologist, we can say that maybe Vin Diesel's household growing up contained some elements of mysticism, New Age paganism,Â  and maybe even a little bit of the occult.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.cnn.com/2002-08-12/entertainment/people.cel.diesel_1_pavla-hrbkova-bouncer-roles?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ" title="Vin Diesel: From nightclub bouncer to action hero">[1]</a> But that may be going too far. Essentially, he seems wholly non-religious.


## Politics

Diesel has yet to share his political and religious views with the public.

And while Vin Diesel has said he feels a "kinship" with President Obama and has expressed a desire to play the president in film,<a class="source-citation" href="http://scrapetv.com/News/News%20Pages/Entertainment/pages-10/Vin-Diesel-itching-to-play-Barack-Obama-in-biopic-Scrape-TV-The-World-on-your-side.html" title="Vin Diesel Itching To Play Barack Obama In Biopic.">[2]</a> he has not necessary endorsed Obama or the Democrats for public office.

Still, an Obama endorsement from Vin wouldn't be at all surprising.
