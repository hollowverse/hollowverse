Erin Andrews was born in Lewiston, Maine. She grew up there and in Tampa, Florida.

I couldn't find anything overtly religious about Andrews. She might be a little bit Christian, but it's tough to say for sure. She will definitely send out her prayers over Twitter when the occasion arises–from wishing her friend with cancer the best<a class="source-citation" href="http://tweetwood.com/ErinAndrews/tweet/291002480949608449" title="Erin Andrews tweets.">[1]</a> to sending out her condolences during national tragedies.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ErinAndrews/status/279744319345278976" title="ErinAndrews: As the daughter of an elementary …">[2]</a>

She also sent out this tweet which makes it sound like she has some church-going experience, at least as a youngster:

>I become a little kid laughing in church when people are making noises at the gym..STOP!!! I can't quit laughing!!!!<a class="source-citation" href="http://tweetwood.com/ErinAndrews/tweet/251717788513751040" title="Erin Andrews tweets.">[3]</a>

So, I don't know. I can't give you any conclusive information here, but I can say that it's fairly likely that she has some sort of a Christian background but isn't too terribly devout.


## It's a man's world

Erin Andrews is a woman in a man's world; there's no doubt about it. If you're a woman, especially one known for your good looks, and you're hired to be an expert about any male-dominated sport–especially football–people are going to assume that you are less knowledgeable than your male counterparts. So almost necessarily, Andrews is a spokeswoman for feminism and equal treatment for women. When asked what she thinks about those who criticize attractive female sports reporters, she said,

>I think it's hilarious that you can't worry about getting your roots done, working out, worrying about what shoes you're wearing, and have cool jewelry and know sports. . . . Why can't you worry about the way you look and also like sports? . . . I want to prove to people that I know more, that I'm not here because of what I look like or that [it's because] I'm a female.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/14/erin-andrews-opens-up-about-career-family-dancing-and-the-law/" title="Erin Andrews Opens Up About Career, Family, Dancing and the Law.">[4]</a>

And Andrews isn't just defending women in her male-dominated workforce. The sportscaster was the victim of stalking after a man followed her from state to state, spying into her hotel rooms and eventually recording a video of her nude which he uploaded to the internet. Since then, she has become an advocate for tougher stalking laws, actively lobbying Congress for the cause.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.judiciaryreport.com/erin_andrews_in_congress.htm" title="Erin Andrews In Congress.">[5]</a>

As far as partisan politics go, signs point toward Democrat, but I can't be positive. She hasn't thrown her overt support behind Obama, but she's hinted at it. She retweeted this from the White House's twitter feed, so it would appear that she monitors updates from the Obama camp:

>Amen RT @whitehouse: Obama: "Finally, let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11, that we have never forgotten your loss"<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/ErinAndrews/status/64900977458806784" title="ErinAndrews: Amen RT @whitehouse: Obama: …">[6]</a>

She was also watching Obama's victory speech on election night in 2012, although she never said whether or not she voted for him.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ksl.com/?nid=757&sid=22870129" title="Romney loss leaves many wondering where he will go next.">[7]</a>

So the jury might still be out, but it's definitely leaning liberal. Let us know if you find a smoking gun.
