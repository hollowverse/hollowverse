Katie Price, also known professionally as Jordan, was born and raised in Brighton, England.

Well, as clich√© as it may sound, I think money really is Katie Price's religion. Fitting, with that last name and all; she really does put a price on everything. Although I couldn't confirm that it actually happened, she was at least at one point planning on selling on eBay the breast implants she had removed during breast implant reduction surgery.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/celebrity/news/a213594/price-to-auction-breast-implants-on-ebay.html" title="Price to auction breast implants on eBay?">[1]</a>

But lets take a few steps back. Price's maternal grandmother is Jewish, and with the whole matrilineal Jewish heritage thing, that would technically make Price Jewish as well. But the verdict of "Barely Jew"<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=502" title="Jordon (Katie Price).">[2]</a> by the internet's barometer of Jewness, the website [Jew or Not Jew](http://www.jewornotjew.com/index.jsp), is in my opinion generous.

When one reporter asked her why she doesn't call herself a Jew, she said it's because she doesn't practice the religion. And then, bringing to the conversation the negative stereotype of the money-hungry Jew, she pontificated that maybe that heritage was what made her so greedy about money.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/katie-price-we-love-to-earn-money-who-doesnt-955318.html" title="Katie Price: &apos;We love to earn money, who doesn&apos;t?&apos;">[3]</a>

But don't take that to mean she doesn't respect religion. She insists that she's not judging anyone about it, and that they shouldn't judge her:

>I'm useless at any religion. I'm so open-minded I don't judge anybody on anything, and I think that is the best way to be. . . . Money and religion are the big things, and that's it, and I stay away from religion. We love to earn money, who doesn't?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/katie-price-we-love-to-earn-money-who-doesnt-955318.html" title="Katie Price: &apos;We love to earn money, who doesn&apos;t?&apos;">[4]</a>

I don't know, but it sure sounds to me like she's focusing in on making money with religious dedication.


## Fiscal Policy and the Not Intelligent

By Price's own admission, she is mostly non-political, but she still has opinions. She said,

>I don't get involved in party politics or pay much attention to what David Cameron says because I think he's hard to notice. But I have a view on things that are political and if I think something needs changing, I fight for what I believe is right. I'm not a quitter.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4152415/Suns-new-columnist-Katie-Price-Im-not-just-boobs-lashes-and-fake-tan.html" title="Sun&apos;s new columnist Katie Price: I&apos;m not just boobs, lashes and fake tan.">[5]</a>

She created a little bit of a stir among British bloggers when she started tweeting one day about quantitative easing and fiscal union relating to the European debt crisis.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-uk-model-jordan-suddenly-starts-tweeting-about-the-eurozone-crisis-and-quantitative-easing-2012-1" title="Famous UK Model Jordan Suddenly Starts Tweeting About The Eurozone Crisis And Quantitative Easing.">[6]</a> In one tweet she wrote:

>Large scale quantitative easing in 2012 could distort liquidity of govt. bond market. #justsayin<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.businessinsider.com/famous-uk-model-jordan-suddenly-starts-tweeting-about-the-eurozone-crisis-and-quantitative-easing-2012-1" title="Famous UK Model Jordan Suddenly Starts Tweeting About The Eurozone Crisis And Quantitative Easing.">[7]</a>

Just sayin' indeed. This is coming from a woman who said she was "not intelligent."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/features/4152415/Suns-new-columnist-Katie-Price-Im-not-just-boobs-lashes-and-fake-tan.html" title="Sun&apos;s new columnist Katie Price: I&apos;m not just boobs, lashes and fake tan.">[8]</a> But, as I found out thanks to a diligent reader, it turns out the whole thing was just an advertising campaign for Snickers. The last tweet in the series stated, "You're not you when you're hungry @snickeruk."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.itv.com/news/2012-03-07/twitter-cleared-of-phony-celebrity-tweets/" title="Celebrity tweets cleared by advertising watchdog.">[9]</a>

So once again she reveals she'll do anything for money, including exploit her non-intelligence on Twitter. Non-political it is!
