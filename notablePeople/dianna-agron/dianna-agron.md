Dianna Agron was born Savannah, Georgia and grew up between San Antonio, Texas and San Francisco, California.

Agron is Jewish. Her father is a lifelong Jew and her mother converted. Agron attended Hebrew school for a time and had a Bat Mitzvah.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://idolator.com/6334692/happy-passover-15-pop-stars-you-didnt-know-were-jewish" title="Happy Passover! 15 Pop Stars You Didn&apos;t Know Were Jewish">[1]</a>

She isn't averse to talking about her heritage and has even cracked a joke or two about the fact that she is out of her element playing a Bible-reciting, cross-bearing Christian on her show, Glee!.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://screenrant.com/glees-season-premiere-hits-high-note-san-diego-comic-con-kofi-19089/" title="&apos;Glee&apos; Season Premiere Hits a High Note at Comic-Con">[2]</a>

Agron has talked about being persecuted during high school, using her experiences to relate to the gay community. She once said:

>There are words and names that one might hear that would be far worse than, 'latke girl!' I cannot imagine the strength it requires to endure the constant torture one might be subject to [as a young gay person].<a class="source-citation" href="#http://popcrush.com/glee-dianna-agron-support-gay-rights-the-trevor-project/" title="&apos;Glee Star Dianna Agron Uses Website to Support Gay Rights and the Trevor Project">[3]</a>

## Gleeful politics

Agron is quite liberal politically. Her favorite causes are animal rights and gay rights.

Agron is a vegetarian,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/tags/Dianna+Agron/default.aspx" title="The PETA Files">[4]</a> a supporter of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) and was even nominated the 2010 "Sexiest Vegetarian" by that organization.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://amp.cbslocal.com/2010/06/22/peta-nominates-glee-star-for-sexiest-vegetarian/" title="PETA Nominates &apos;Glee&apos; Star for Sexiest Vegetarian">[5]</a>

But she's much more outspoken about her concern for the gay community. She once wrote:

>Sadly, we've gotten letters from people who explain that they love the show but hate the gay story-lines. That we shouldn't be polluting their children's heads. To this I'd sometimes like to sarcastically reply, 'Would you also like us to tell them that a stork is dropping off our offspring? That the sky is purple? That it is not practical to be true to yourself..?"<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.teenhollywood.com/2011/06/13/agron-speaks-up-for-gay-rights" title="Dianna Agron Speaks Up For Gay Rights">[6]</a>

Agron even met once with President Obama as a supporter of Obama's "Young America Effort." She later tweeted:

>Maybe the only man I truly get nervous around. Worth the early wake-up call.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebuzz.com/2012-06-08/dianna-agron-jessica-alba-meet-with-president-obama-in-beverly-hills-photo/" title="Dianna Agron, Jessica Alba Meet With President Obama in Beverly Hills">[7]</a>
