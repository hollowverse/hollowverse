Jamie Lynn Spears was born and raised mostly in McComb, Mississippi.

Spears is a Christian, more specifically a Baptist. She grew up going to a Christian school, the Parklane Academy in McComb.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://recenttopnewsoftheworld.blogspot.com/2011/04/jamie-lynn-spears-is-no-longer-teen.html" title="Jamie Lynn Spears is no longer a teen">[1]</a> Her pop star sister, Britney, spoke much more of the family's religious upbringing than Jamie Lynn has–so far. She said:

>I'm a Baptist I grew up going to church, but I think you can have spiritual experiences without going to church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.bebo.com/BlogView.jsp?MemberId=5553346408&BlogId=5605678000" title="I Believe in Britney">[2]</a>

At the age of 16, Jamie Lynn became pregnant. She wasn't married–hopefully that would be obvious. She was widely criticized for being a teen role model who could exacerbate the American teen pregnancy problem. But interestingly, Christians came to her side, pointing out that Spears had met the baby's father in church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.patheos.com/blogs/getreligion/2007/12/casting-stones-at-jamie-lynn/" title="Casting Stones at Jamie Lynn">[3]</a> …So, it's OK I guess.

I would say that Spears remains a good role model–perhaps not for teens–but for the human race. She owned the problem, accepted responsibility for her own life, and got on with it:

>I put myself in this position, an adult position, so I have to be an adult and take responsibility for what I did. I've really become at peace with the whole situation.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.helium.com/items/1663534-the-best-jamie-lynn-spears-quotes" title="The best Jamie Lynn Spears quotes">[4]</a>

## Conservative sweetie pie

Spears hasn't expressed any political views. Her family is often considered to be a bit more conservative. Her sister, Britney, was a supporter of George W. Bush and the Iraq War.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://newsmine.org/content.php?ol=cabal-elite/w-administration/britney-supports-bush.txt" title="Britney supports Bush">[5]</a> But she turned around and gave her endorsement to Obama in 2008.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.popeater.com/2011/03/10/britney-spears-anti-bullying-campaign/" title="Britney Spears Joins Obama&apos;s Anti-Bullying Campaign">[6]</a>

Spears was, before her very public fall from fame and fortune, a favorite among conservative parents, who saw her TV shows as wholesome and non-threatening.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.patheos.com/blogs/getreligion/2007/12/casting-stones-at-jamie-lynn/" title="Casting Stones at Jamie Lynn">[7]</a> Then again, even liberal parents like wholesome and non-threatening TV shows for their kids.

She did say that she was "scared" to ask for birth control, which was why she got pregnant so young. I'm tempted to call that a sort of byproduct of a conservative worldview. What do you guys think?
