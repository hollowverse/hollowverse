2 Chainz, whose real name is Tauheed Epps and has been called Tity Boi and Wain Beezy, was born and raised in College Park, Georgia, just outside of Atlanta.

Accounts regarding 2 Chainz' religion and upbringing vary. Wikipedia says his father was a minister and 2 Chainz was raised in a religious home–presumably Christian.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2_Chainz" title="2 Chainz">[1]</a> Other accounts say his father was in and out of prison and effectively absent.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.aceshowbiz.com/celebrity/2_chainz/biography.html" title="2 Chainz Biography and Life Story">[2]</a> The latter seems more credible, however, and quotes 2 Chainz about his father's absence.

So, our wild goose chase has brought us back to… not knowing anything about 2 Chainz' religious upbringing. It's certainly not something he talks about.


## Felony politics

2 Chainz does have a political agenda. He is a felon as a result of a drug charge at the age of 15 and in 2012, amidst the U.S. elections, he traveled around the country hoping to inform felons that there are ways in which they can overcome their past and get out and vote. He said:

>As a felon you somewhat become disenfranchised. You don't have a say-so over what goes on in your personal community.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://popdust.com/2012/10/30/2-chainz-gets-political-campaigns-for-voting-rights-for-convicted-felons/" title="Two Chainz is Helping Convicted Felons Be Able to Vote Again">[3]</a>

He gave them hope, saying:

>You can vote again. You just have to have all your restitution paid off and you can't be on probation or parole. It's just really easy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/2-chainz-and-felons-ability-to-vote/" title="2 Chainz and Felons&apos; Ability to Vote">[4]</a>

But who did 2 Chainz support in said elections? Well, we can assume it was Obama. When asked if he would personally have a chance against Romney, he said:

>I think I can beat him — he's just rich as shit, that's all.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/09/2-chainz-mitt-romney-based-on-a-tru-story_n_1758029.html" title="2 Chainz On Being Mitt Romney&apos;s Running Mate, Advocating For Felons &amp; &apos;Based On A T.R.U. Story.&apos;">[5]</a>

I don't imagine 2 Chainz is in the poor house, but he's probably no Bain Capital.
