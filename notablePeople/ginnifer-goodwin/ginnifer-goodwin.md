Ginnifer Goodwin, born Jennifer Goodwin, was born and raised in Memphis, Tennessee.

Goodwin is Jewish. She attended Jewish summer camp growing up and was an active member of Memphis' B'nai B'rith Youth Organization at their Jewish Community Center.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.juf.org/tweens/celebrity.aspx?id=30364" title="Ginnifer Goodwin">[1]</a> She also had a Bat Mitzvah.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nextmovie.com/blog/jewish-movie-stars/" title="20 Movie Stars You Didn&apos;t Know Were Jewish">[2]</a>

But it's not something she really discusses in detail. During an interview with fellow Jewish starlet, Kate Hudson, she discussed familial/religious connections between herself and the interviewer.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sdjewishjournal.com/site/2011/ginnifer-goodwin-and-kate-hudson-talk-life-love-and-jewish-geography-in-%E2%80%98marie-claire%E2%80%99-magazine/" title="Ginnifer Goodwin and Kate Hudson Talk Life, Love and &apos;Jewish Geography&apos; in Marie Claire Magazine">[3]</a> But other than that, Goodwin seems either largely non-religious or just quiet about her faith.

On an interesting side-note, Goodwin did play one of a handful of wives on the show about fringe-Mormon polygamy, Big Love.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.vulture.com/2011/03/ginnifer_goodwin_on_the_end_of.html" title="Ginnifer Goodwin on the End of Big Love">[4]</a> When asked about her views on polygamy, she said:

>I am much more open to plural marriage than I was before, and I now support it in certain situations. I do believe it is right for some people. But our example in America today is gross abuse – I can't support it in fundamentalist compounds.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/g/ginnifer_goodwin.html?vm=l" title="Ginnifer Goodwin Quotes">[5]</a>

Just goes to show you how a little knowledge can change one's perspective.


## Good, winning politics

Insights into Goodwin's politics come mostly through her Twitter feed. During the 2012 elections, it's clear that she was an Obama supporter when she retweeted the recently re-elected president's message:

>This happened because of you. Thank you.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/ginnygoodwin" title="Ginnifer Goodwin (ginnygoodwin) on Twitter">[6]</a>

Later, she retweeted yet another Obama message in favor of gay marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/ginnygoodwin" title="Ginnifer Goodwin (ginnygoodwin) on Twitter">[7]</a> Still more, she retweeted an Obama message in favor of gun control.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/ginnygoodwin" title="Ginnifer Goodwin (ginnygoodwin) on Twitter">[8]</a>

So that makes her an Obama-supporting, pro-gay marriage, pro-gun control liberal Democrat, I would say.

Beyond that, Goodwin has had a lot to say about the female body image. Goodwin admits that she's always struggled with her weight and has adopted many specialized eating practices to control it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.cnn.com/2010/HEALTH/12/30/ginnifer.goodwin.health/index.html" title="Ginnifer Goodwin: &apos;Healthy is Beautiful">[9]</a> As a result, she has spoken out about the damage American society can have on a girl's body image.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebitchy.com/157865/ginnifer_goodwin_i_have_very_real_hips_a_real_southern_womans_ass/" title="Ginnifer Goodwin: &quot;I have very real hips &amp; a real Southern woman&apos;s ass">[10]</a>

I'm not sure that's a partisan view–perhaps you readers can weigh in.
