Lolo Jones, whose real name is Lori Jones, was born and raised in Des Moines, Iowa.

Jones is a devout Evangelical Christian and she even lived in a church for a time during her childhood because her family was so poor.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-2185076/Lolo-Jones-admits-stop-discussing-virginity-public-finishes-fourth-Olympic-final.html" title="Lolo Jones admits she should stop discussing her virginity in public as she finishes fourth in Olympic final">[1]</a> To this day, Jones' faith is central in her life, something she credits for her athletic success. She tweeted upon arriving in London for the Olympic games:

>As I arrive in London for the Olympics, I'm overwhelmed with emotions. Thank you Lord for another chance and for holding me as I waited.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.christianpost.com/news/christian-olympians-give-god-the-praise-at-london-summer-games-78913/" title="Christian Olympians Give God the Praise at London Summer Games">[2]</a>

And before races, Jones is known to read the Bible and listen to Christian music to put her in a good head-space for competition.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/under-god/post/lolo-jones-virginity-harder-than-training-for-olympics/2012/05/23/gJQAVrxRkU_blog.html" title="Lolo Jones: Virginity &apos;harder than training for Olympics.&apos;">[3]</a>

Unfortunately, Jones didn't win a medal and was ruthlessly ridiculed for it in the media. It was a trying time, one which caused her to seek comfort in God. She said:

>Lord Jesus please comfort me, guide me, and heal my broken heart.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://thegrio.com/2012/08/12/christian-athletes-in-the-2012-olympics-lolo-jones-allyson-felix-gabby-douglas-and-more/#s:gabby-allyson-sanya-gold-medalists-16x9" title="Christian athletes in the 2012 Olympics: Lolo Jones, Alyson Felix, Gabby Douglas and more">[4]</a>

So devoted is Jones that she has chosen to remain a virgin until marriage–something she has admitted is quite difficult:

>…it's the hardest thing I've ever done in my life. Harder than training for the Olympics. Harder than graduating from college has been to stay a virgin before marriage. I've been tempted, I've had plenty of opportunities.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2012-heavy-medal-london/post/hurdler-lolo-jones-virginity-has-been-harder-than-training-for-london-olympics/2012/05/23/gJQAOQo7kU_blog.html" title="Hurdler Lolo Jones: Virginity has been harder than training for the London Olympics">[5]</a>

Interestingly, Jones' Twitter followers suggest she court fellow Christian athlete, Tim Tebow, and she appeared receptive. She said:

>I'm pretty sure I'm just going to invite Tebow to church. It's a 100% way not to get rejected.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.christianpost.com/news/lolo-jones-wants-to-ask-tim-tebow-on-a-church-date-77325/" title="Lolo Jones Wants to Ask Tim Tebow On A Church Date?">[6]</a>

Despite Jones' devotion to her faith and the fact that she eschews unmarried sex, she has been widely criticized for posing nude–or near-nude–for various magazines.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/09/lolo-jones-new-york-times-too-harsh-public-editor_n_1760725.html" title="Lolo Jones New York Times Article Deemed &apos;Too Harsh&apos; By Public Editor">[7]</a>

That's the sharp edge of fame, for you. Just keep on runnin' Lolo.


## Run, Lolo, Run

Jones isn't about to get into political specifics. No comments on the budget or abortion or gay marriage or any of that "stuff." We could speculate what her political views might be based on her religiosity, but I've written enough of these articles to know that's a bad idea.

She did liken herself to an American soldier in a way. During a response to the media backlash against her following her inability to win a medal in the 2012 London Olympics, she said:

>I don't think I should be ripped apart by media. I laid it out there, fought hard for my country and it's just a shame that I have to deal with so much backlash when I'm already so brokenhearted as it is.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2012/08/08/olympian-lolo-jones-scolds-ny-times-for-ripping-her-to-shreds-in-tearful-tv-interview-i-fought-hard-for-my-country/" title="Olympian Lolo Jones Scolds New York Times for &apos;Ripping Her To Shreds&apos; in Tearful TV Interview">[8]</a>

If I had my way, I'd write the caption to say: 'Murica!

She did meet Obama after the Olympics, and he was much kinder than the media, giving her a hug and saying to Jones:

>You could not have been better ambassadors for the United States.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.kcci.com/news/central-iowa/Lolo-Jones-gets-hug-at-the-White-House/-/9357080/16604520/-/mfg14l/-/index.html" title="Lolo Jones gets hug at the White House">[9]</a>

She's a patriot and a warrior for the U.S. That's about as political as she gets.
