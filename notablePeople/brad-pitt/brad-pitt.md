summaries:
  religion: "Brad Pitt grew up in Missouri with two devout Baptist parents. He even sang in the church choir. But he's since said religion doesn't do it for him. He claims to be 20% atheist and 80% agnostic."
  politicalViews: "Pitt leans pretty far to the left. He's supported the last two Democratic presidential candidates, spoken out about U.S. wars, championed environmental, poverty, and legal marijuana causes."

Brad Pitt grew up in the U.S. Bible belt–Springfield, Missouri. His parents are devout Christians who started out Baptists but have since become more Evangelical.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radaronline.com%2Fexclusives%2F2011%2F09%2Fbrad-pitt-slams-christian-upbringing-religion-didn-t-work-me" title="Brad Pitt Turns His Back On Religion: &apos;Didn&apos;t Work for Me">[1]</a>

But Brad has been very open about his disagreements with the religion of his youth, and even religion in general. He said:

>Many people find religion to be very inspiring. Myself, I found it very stifling. I grew up with Christianity and I remember questioning it greatly. Some things didn't work for me. Some things did…I grew up being told God is going to take care of everything and it doesn't always work out that way. And then you're told 'Well, it's God's will.' I got my issues. Man, you don't want to get me started.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FEntertainment%2Fbrad-pitt-katy-perry-back-christian-beliefs%2Fstory%3Fid%3D13620940%23.T0fLsIFuDAk" title="Brad Pitt, Katy Perry and More Go Back on Christian Beliefs">[2]</a>

In fact, for a celebrity of Pitt's caliber, he's been amazingly blunt and forthcoming about his beliefs, saying:

>I'm probably 20 percent atheist and 80 percent agnostic. I don't think anyone really knows. You'll either find out or not when you get there, until then there's no point thinking about it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.cbn.com%2Fhollywoodinsight%2Farchive%2F2011%2F05%2F20%2Fbrad-pitt-finds-religion-stifling.aspx" title="Brad Pitt Find Religion &apos;Stifling.&apos;">[3]</a>

## Let's all get high

Politically, Pitt has spoken out about quite a few causes, almost all of them associated with the liberal left. One of the things Pitt would most like to see is the legalization of marijuana in the U.S. A friend of his has said:

>He's obsessed with legalizing pot. He believes it would be the biggest moneymaker since the Internet.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.showbizspy.com%2Farticle%2F205087%2Fbrad-pitt-eyes-political-career-keen-to-legalize-cannabis.html" title="Brad Pitt Eyes Political Career, Keen to Legalize Cannabis!">[4]</a>

When Pitt jokingly ran for the mayor of New Orleans, he said:

>Yeah, I'm running on the gay marriage, no religion, legalization and taxation of marijuana platform.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fperezhilton.com%2F2009-08-13-brad-pitt-wants-to-legalize-marijuana%23.T0fRc4FuDAk" title="Brad Pitt Wants to Legalize Marijuana!!!">[5]</a>

That sounds fun. But seriously, can we get serious here? Sure. Pitt has taken on many causes of far greater concern than teenagers getting baked in their parents' basements without fear of legal consequences.

Pitt's really concerned about the environment and the living conditions in third-world countries. He'd like to see the end of their exploitation and a more "one world, one standard" approach to politics. He's said:

>Shouldn't the argument be, what's not good enough for us is not good enough for them? In the movie business, we can't burn toxic things when we film in the United States. So we go to Morocco and burn all the rubber tires we like when we're doing action scenes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fusliberals.about.com%2Fod%2Fcelebrityactivists%2Fp%2FBradPitt.htm" title="Profile of Brad Pitt, Activist &amp; Filmmaker">[6]</a>
