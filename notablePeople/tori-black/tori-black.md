Tori Black, whose real name is Michelle Chapman, was born and raised in Seattle, Washington.

Every time a porn star doesn't show any indication of religion, I'm always tempted to chalk it up to the apparent disjunction between conservative religious beliefs and the porn star lifestyle. But this time I have at least a tiny bit of proof.

In one video I found, in the two minutes and 52 seconds that Black spends lamenting the fact that some women actually die without ever experiencing an orgasm, she said she thought conservative religious and societal pressures are what allow that tragedy to happen.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BmLZRZXZ3ig" title="Tori Black interview.">[1]</a>

Well, there you have it. The non-religious porn star. No big surprise there.

Tori Black appears to be non-political as well. She didn't even have anything to say on her Twitter feed about the 2012 presidential election. If she thinks about politics, maybe being a porn star makes her a liberal regarding social values, or maybe it makes her a libertarian in terms of minimal governmental regulations on her industry. It's tough to say.

Do you think it makes her sounds liberal that she drinks smoothies from Whole Foods made of almond milk, berries, spinach, and kale?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pheed.com/misstoriblack/2140181/15190" title="Tori Black&apos;s text pheed.">[2]</a> Do you think it makes her sound liberal that she apparently breastfeeds her baby?<a class="source-citation" href="http://filmdrunk.uproxx.com/2012/01/tori-black-arrested-after-breast-milk-fight" title="Tori Black Arrested After Breast Milk Fight.">[3]</a> Well, probably not.

In the end, let's just stick with non-political before my stereotyping gets me in trouble. If you have any information that I missed, let us know in the comments!
