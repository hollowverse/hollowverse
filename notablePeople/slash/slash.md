Slash was born Saul Hudson in Hampstead, London to a white English father and a black American mother. When he was five-years-old he moved to Los Angeles with his mother, and currently retains dual citizenship.

Despite popular belief, Slash is not Jewish.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/25-things-you-dont-know-about-me-slash-201112" title="25 Things You Don&apos;t Know About Me: Slash.">[1]</a> But aside from debunking that rumor, he hasn't said much about his religious beliefs, which is probably an indication that he doesn't have any.


## Angst or Atheism?

Slash might not talk about religion, but he did write about it. He and Axel Rose slammed organized religion in the song "Garden of Eden":

>Most organized religions make/A mockery of humanity/Our governments are dangerous/And out of control/The garden of Eden is just another graveyard/Said if they had someone to buy it/Said I'm sure they'd sell my soul.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/gunsnroses/gardenofeden.html" title="Guns N&apos; Roses Lyrics">[2]</a>

That song could have been a product of a young man's disillusion with the machine of mainstream culture, or it could have been a genuine rejection of religion–and politics for that matter. Whatever the case, he has never been an outspoken atheist or agnostic.

Slash's politics are undoubtedly liberal: he donated to Obama's presidential election in 2008.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?st=CA&last=Hudson&first=Saul" title="Saul Hudson&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[3]</a> But most of his political activism revolves around his love of animals.

## Animal Activism

He is currently on the board at the Los Angeles Zoo<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lazoo.org/about/glaza/" title="Greater Los Angeles Zoo Association.">[4]</a> and came out in staunch support of a controversial new elephant exhibit. After playing a concert at a private event to support the exhibit, Slash said,

>I just jumped right in support of Billy [the elephant] and the zoo and the whole development that was happening.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.scpr.org/news/2010/12/16/21981/rocker-and-la-zoo-board-member-slash-defends-new-e/" title="Rocker and LA Zoo board member Slash defends new elephant habitat.">[5]</a>

He also helped launch the Bob Irwin Wildlife and Conservation Foundation in Brisbane, Austrilia. Bob Irwin, father of the late Steve Irwin of Crocodile Hunter fame, said about Slash:

>The best thing about this guy is he's right into conservation and I love him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/breaking-news/slash-to-launch-bob-irwin-foundation/story-fn3dxiwe-1226455422709" title="Irwin leaves rocker Slash starstruck.">[6]</a>

His support of animals is obvious, but when you look at the twinkle in the sunglasses of one of the world's greatest guitar soloist with a 13-foot python wrapped around his neck, you get the feeling that he doesn't care about the politics so much. He just wants to hold the animals.
