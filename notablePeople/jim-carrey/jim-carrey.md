Jim Carrey was born in Newmarket, Ontario, Canada. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 2004 but still holds citizenship in Canada.

He was raised a Catholic but dabbled in Presbyterianism later in life.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nndb.com/people/757/000022691/" title="Jim Carrey">[1]</a> Despite his funnyman reputation, one gets the sense when studying Carrey that he's a complex, searching person. He spoke about looking for spiritual answers as a child and being inspired by the Buddha<a class="source-citation" href="#http://spiritlibrary.com/videos/eckhart-tolle/jim-carrey-on-awakening" title="Jim Carrey on awakening">[2]</a> but has also expressed a distrust of organized religions.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.chacha.com/question/what-is-jim-carrey%27s-religion" title="What is Jim Carrey&apos;s Religion?">[3]</a>

He's cracked jokes about Scientologists<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbZYuOuvyK4" title="Jim Carrey Mocks Scientology">[4]</a> and, as of yet, hasn't joined Kabbalah but he did seem to latch onto Oprah's favorite religious non-religion–the cult of Eckhart Tolle.

Tolle's New Age somewhat ambiguous, generic spirituality has attracted another celebrity. But Carrey seems like a smart guy, so maybe I'm missing something. He spoke at Tolle's Inaugural GATE Event (Global Alliance for Transformational Entertainment) and seemed very serious about it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://spiritlibrary.com/videos/eckhart-tolle/jim-carrey-on-awakening" title="Jim Carrey on awakening">[5]</a>

## Outside politics

Carrey, maybe because he's Canadian, expresses a sense of the political situation outside of the United States–and even North America. He is a pro-democracy advocate and made a video that circulated the internet raising awareness and showing support for Burmese democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/101-jim-carrey" title="Jim Carrey">[6]</a>

When asked about the newly-elected Barack Obama in 2008 (who he supports) Carrey's response was mainly about U.S. relations with the rest of the world. He said:

>It's amazing to see the difference in one day after he was elected… We've been doing everything in our power in the last eight years to make [other countries] dislike us. We've completely discounted other people for the last eight years and I think this is a sign to them that we understand that they're there and that we have to play ball with everybody.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QinR7d5na28" title="Jim Carrey on Barack Obama">[7]</a>

He's also jumped on the purist medication, liberal train and protested the use of toxic vaccines in children by marching in Washington D.C.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.babble.com/CS/blogs/famecrawler/archive/2008/06/04/green-our-vaccines-jim-carrey-and-jenny-mccarthy-get-political.aspx" title="Green Our Vaccines: Jim Carrey and Jenny McCarthy Get Political">[8]</a>
