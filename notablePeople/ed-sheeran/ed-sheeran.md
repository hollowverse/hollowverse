Ed Sheeran was born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, England and grew up there and in Framlingham, Suffolk, England.

Sheeran doesn't talk about religion all that much. One fan claimed that he said he was a Christian in a radio interview,<a class="source-citation" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_ed_sheeran_a_christian" title="Is ed sheeran a chirstian.">[1]</a> but I couldn't find the recording. It seems pretty likely, though.

A few of his songs have Christian imagery<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/edsheeran/theateam.html" title="ED SHEERAN LYRICS – The A Team.">[2]</a> or mention God.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metrolyrics.com/uni-lyrics-ed-sheeran.html" title="ED SHEERAN – U.N.I. LYRICS.">[3]</a> And he posted this on his Twitter feed:

>"God knows I failed but he knows that I tried"<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/edsheeran/status/173082380976922625" title="edsheeran: &quot;God know I failed but he …">[4]</a>

So maybe he doesn't talk about his religion because he keeps it mostly private and not many people have cared to ask. But regardless of the nature of his faith, I think it's a safe bet to say he's probably a Christian.

The political side of Sheeran is equally as subdued. I would assume that's because he's not particularly political. He does lean his celebrity weight onto one issue, however, that is a little controversial.

The singer-songwriter performed a gig for the charity One25 which raised £40,000 to help street sex workers. His song "[The A Team](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAWcs5H-qgQ)" is about a woman in that industry whom he met while working at a homeless shelter, and what inspired him to throw his celebrity behind issue. He said about his support,

>It's good to show insight that these people are real people with real emotions and they deserve the same charity work as anyone else. . . . And with certain subjects like this they're often washed over and people don't necessarily give them the attention they deserve.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-18163708" title="Ed Sheeran gig in Bristol raises £40,000 for One25.">[5]</a>

So his silence on political matters isn't because he doesn't want to be controversial. Maybe we'll hear more from him yet. Keep us updated in the comments.
