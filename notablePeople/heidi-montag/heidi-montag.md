Heidi Montag was born and raised in Crested Butte, Colorado.

She considers herself "very religious" and believes it to be the main reason that she's been so successful in life.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsbusters.org%2Fblogs%2Fcarolyn-plocher%2F2010%2F01%2F13%2Fheidi-montag-modern-mother-theresa-who-sings-dirty-songs" title="Heidi Montag: A &apos;Modern Mother Teresa&apos; Who Sings Dirty Songs?">[1]</a> She planned at one point to record a Christian album, although that didn't pan out. When asked about it she said,

>I have been the most religious person since I was 2 years old. I always felt this crazy connection to God. [I consider myself] kind of non-denominational Baptist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justjared.com%2F2008%2F06%2F30%2Fheidi-montag-jesus%2F" title="Heidi Montag Compares Herself To Jesus Christ.">[2]</a>

I'm not totally sure what non-denominational Baptist means, especially since she was married at a Presbyterian church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20274780%2C00.html" title="Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt Get Married – Again!">[3]</a> So maybe by non-denominational Baptist she meant non-denominational. Anyway. . .

She's taken some heat for what critics call not-so-Christian actions, like releasing an album heavy with sexual content,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsbusters.org%2Fblogs%2Fcarolyn-plocher%2F2010%2F01%2F13%2Fheidi-montag-modern-mother-theresa-who-sings-dirty-songs" title="Heidi Montag: A &apos;Modern Mother Teresa&apos; Who Sings Dirty Songs?">[4]</a> comparing criticism of herself to the persecution of Jesus,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justjared.com%2F2008%2F06%2F30%2Fheidi-montag-jesus%2F" title="Heidi Montag Compares Herself To Jesus Christ.">[5]</a> and posing nude in Playboy. But Montag doesn't miss a beat. In fact, she believes nude modelling is right in line with God's plan. She said,

>I think we're born naked. We die naked. I don't think it's something to be ashamed of. I think the body is a beautiful piece of artwork that God created. I have nothing to be ashamed of.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsbusters.org%2Fblogs%2Fcarolyn-plocher%2F2010%2F01%2F13%2Fheidi-montag-modern-mother-theresa-who-sings-dirty-songs" title="Heidi Montag: A &apos;Modern Mother Teresa&apos; Who Sings Dirty Songs?">[6]</a>

Montag might interpret her faith a little differently than other Christians, but she's clearly very devoted and inspired by her religious beliefs–critics be damned!


## Republican here, Democrat there, who's cares?

Montag is a Republican and supported John McCain during the 2008 presidential election, although she said she didn't know why anyone would care to know.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesuperficial.com%2Fheidi_montag_endorses_john_mcc-04-2008" title="Heidi Montag get political.">[7]</a> Well, Heidi, we care. We really do.

She was also enamored with McCain's running-mate Sarah Palin. She said about the former Alaskan governor,

>Sarah Palin will do well. She is such a strong, independent woman. I'm her biggest fan.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fstory%2F0%2C2933%2C445104%2C00.html" title="Pop Tarts: McCain-Lovin&apos; Heidi Montag Buys &apos;Obama&apos; Themed Portrait Mocking Her Breasts.">[8]</a>

But then in 2009, just before his inauguration, she was seen wearing an Obama t-shirt.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fsocialitelife.com%2Fphotos%2Fheidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-embrace-barack-obama%2Fheidi-montag-and-spencer-pratt-wearing-obama-tshirt-photos-2" title="Heidi Montag And Spencer Pratt Embrace Barack Obama.">[9]</a> That's a pretty quick change of heart. Maybe she's a Democrat now. After all, she departed from the Republican position on at least one issue. She mentioned gay gossip blogger Perez Hilton in a tweet about gay marriage when she wrote,

>God says in the bible that we should love our neighbor and he created us all as equals. I know in my heart that gays and lesbians should have the same government rights that Spencer and I will when we get married. So, yes, this blonde Christian believes in gay marriage and I hope to one day go to your wedding, Perez!!!<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mtv.com%2Fnews%2Farticles%2F1609756%2Fbritney-spears-miley-cyrus-heidi-montag-tweet-about-same-sex-marriage.jhtml" title="Britney Spears, Miley Cyrus, Heidi Montag Tweet About Same-Sex Marriage.">[10]</a>

So it's tough to say where to put Heidi Montag. Maybe she's an opportunist and just goes where the wind blows, or maybe she became a Democrat and voted for Obama the second time around. Or maybe every time she gets a new nose she gets a new political outlook. It's tough to say with this blonde Christian.
