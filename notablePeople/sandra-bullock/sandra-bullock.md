Sandra Bullock was born in Arlington, Virginia.

It is not uncommon for celebrities to conceal their personal beliefs and views. Maybe they are naturally private people or maybe they have something to hide. And Bullock having been accused of loving a Nazi sympathizer,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thesuperficial.com/sandra_bullock_has_secrets-04-2010" title="So Sandra Bullock might be a Nazi">[1]</a> she really might be hiding something. Still, it's odd that a celebrity of Bullock's stature has managed to keep her religious and political views out of the spotlight. In her defense, she once said:

>I don't like to talk about personal things. … And by keeping it private, you have a better shot at a healthy relationship. I learned at a young age that there are certain things you just don't talk about.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113/bio" title="Sandra Bullock – Biography">[2]</a>

Nevertheless, much of the inner-Bullock is up for speculation. Many such speculators have come to the conclusion that, religiously, Bullock is an athiest. I tend to agree. They cite the fact that during interviews, Bullock doesn't say "God" where others might, such as:

>I think, everything works out the way the universe wants it to work out.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Sandra_Bullock" title="Sandra Bullock">[3]</a>

Also, she catches herself during interviews, turning the conversation towards a less controversial direction. For example, when talking about studying a devout Christian family for a film role, she said:

>I now have the blessing of having my res——not a restored faith–but I now have faith in those who say they represent a faith. I finally met people who walk the walk.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Sandra_Bullock" title="Sandra Bullock">[4]</a>

And perhaps the most condemning piece of evidence is her comments on why she didn't want to do the aforementioned role in the first place. She said:

>One of my biggest concerns stepping into this [role] was how people use their faith and their religion as a banner, and then they don't do the right thing. They go, 'I'm a good Christian, and I go to church, and this is the way you should live your life.' And I'm like, do not give me a lecture on how to live my life when you go to church every week, but I know you're still sleeping around on your wife.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.boundlessline.org/2009/12/sandra-bullock-on-christianity.html" title="Sandra Bullock on Christianity">[5]</a>

Ah, yes, the old "religious people are hypocrites" complaint. That's atheist territory for sure.


## Political Secrecy

Bullock's politics are as mysterious, if not more so, than her religion. Here, there are conflicting reports. Allegedly, Bullock self-identified herself as a conservative on her Facebook page at one point.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lemonwade.com/2010/03/22/sandra-bullock-is-a-conservative/" title="Sandra Bullock Is A Conservative">[6]</a> Then again, she is reported to be a Democrat, but has said she has "as many Democratic ideas as she does Republican."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.chacha.com/question/is-sandra-bullock-a-democrat-or-republican" title="Is Sandra Bullock a Democrat or Republican?">[7]</a>

Quite vague indeed.

My rather tenuous conjecture is that Bullock is a bit more liberal than conservative for one reason:

She was a spokesperson for the "Restore the Gulf" campaign after the British Petroleum oil spill gushed millions of gallons of crude into the sea in 2006. The campaign was backed by an organization called America's Wetland Foundation. Apparently, when Bullock signed on to the project, she didn't know that America's Wetland Foundation was a front group run by Shell Oil Corp. to redirect negative attention away from the oil industry. Upon finding out, Bullock quickly cut ties.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2010/07/29/206500/exclusive-sandra-bullock-disowns-bp-backed-greenwashing-campaign/?mobile=nc" title="Sandra Bullock disowns BP-backed greenwashing campaign">[8]</a>

This might indicate that Bullock isn't too keen on the questionable tactics of big business.

Regardless of Bullock's political leanings, she is certainly an incredibly generous and caring individual. She donated $1 million to the Red Cross after the Sept. 11 attacks, another $1 million to the Red Cross after Japan's major 2011 earthquake, and yet another $1 million to Doctors Without Borders after Haiti's 2005 earthquake.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000113/bio" title="Sandra Bullock – Biography">[9]</a>
