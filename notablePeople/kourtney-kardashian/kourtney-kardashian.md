Kourtney Mary Kardashian was born in Mill Valley, California and grew up in Los Angeles, California.

Kourtney graduated from the Roman Catholic, all-girls Marymount High School where she took religion and theology courses with titles like: "Who is Jesus?," "Morality," and "Christian Life and Love."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.examiner.com/article/will-kourtney-kardashian-follow-sister-khloe-and-homeschool-her-children" title="Will Kourtney Kardashian follow sister Khloe and homeschool her children?">[1]</a> But she continued on to attend a Methodist university.<a class="source-citation" href="http://americanpapist.com/2009/08/shock-kourtney-kardashian-decides-to.html" title="Shock: Kourtney Kardashian decides to Keep her Kid">[2]</a>

The Kardashian's father is an Armenian-American and his daughters were exposed to that culture's dominant religion–Armenian Orthodox Christianity. Apparently, they give 10% of their money to the church to this day.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/gallery/Celebrity-Religions/4764/5" title="Celebrity Religions">[3]</a> That is, except Kourtney.

When she and Kim were asked if they donate money, Kim said that she gives 10% to a charity and also gives money to her church because that's what she was taught. When Kourtney was asked if she donates 10% as well, she said:

>I'm going to now, I was taught that too but I forgot about it.<a class="source-citation" href="http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/25/kim-kardashian-gives-10-of-her-money-to-church-and-charity/" title="Kim Kardashian gives 10% of her money to church and charity">[4]</a>

That was probably awkward, but don't go thinking Kourtney is totally non-religious. In a much-publicized surprise pregnancy, Kourtney was considering an abortion (as strange as it may be that the press picked up on this). She decided against the procedure, saying:

>I can't do that. And I felt in my body, this is meant to be. God does things for a reason, and I just felt like it was the right thing that was happening in my life.<a class="source-citation" href="http://americanpapist.com/2009/08/shock-kourtney-kardashian-decides-to.html" title="Shock: Kourtney Kardashian decides to Keep her Kid">[5]</a>

So whatever Kourtney's religion might be–Catholic, Armenian Orthodox, or Methodist–it was a powerful enough force in her life to sway her in a major life decision.


## Politics

Kardashian hasn't gotten very deep into any political territory, but if we can trust her sister, Kim, then she's a Democrat. Kim once said:

>My household is really split-up. The parents are Republicans and the children are Democrats, so it's like a political warfare in our household when we talk about politics.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rS2Fry0u4L0" title="Kim Kardashian says there&apos;s &apos;political warfare&apos; in her house, parents are Republicans">[6]</a>

She goes on to mention Kourtney by name, so I'd say that's a pretty reliable source. Plus, it's no stretch to assume Kourtney is Democrat considering she and her sisters joined up with the NOH8 campaign to overturn California's anti-gay marriage law Prop 8,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dosomething.org/blog/celebsgonegood/the-kardashians-are-h8ers" title="The Kardashians are H8ers">[7]</a> a conservative Republican-sponsored bill. Regardless of the Kardashians' considerable political clout, however, the bill was passed into law.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/11/05/california-gay-marriage-b_n_141429.html" title="California Gay Marriage Banned As Proposition 8 Passes">[8]</a>
