Gwen Stafani was born and raised in Fullerton, California.

Stefani was raised in a devout Catholic household and it seems to have had a profound effect on her. When discussing how she came to develop her now-famous style, she admitted difficulties with percieved contradictions with her faith, saying:

>I always had the pressure of 'You've got to be a feminist and you've got to hate guys. And you've got to cuss and be tough.' And I was never like that. I grew up, like, a Catholic good girl. Total Brady Bunch family… But I kind of got over that and realized that, yes, I love to dress up and I love to wear makeup and be myself.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://web.archive.org/web/20080120225434/http://www.style.com/vogue/feature/032204/page2.html" title="Gwen Stefani: The First Lady of Rock">[1]</a>

Even though she found her style and success with her band, she still seems to have held on to her Christian faith–for a time. Speaking of her love affair with No Doubt bassist Tony Kanal, Stefani said:

>All I ever did was look at Tony and pray that God would let me have a baby with him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2005/jan/30/popandrock.gwenstefani" title="Jenny Eliscu talks to Gwen Stefani">[2]</a>

Now, it's hard to tell if she's kept the faith. Some speculate that she's joined the Rastafari movement, having named her son after Jamaica's capital, Kingston, and wishing for him to be a Rasta DJ when he grows up.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.askmen.com/celebs/entertainment-news/gwen-stefani/gwen-stefani-rasta-son.html" title="Gwen Stefani&apos;s Rasta son">[3]</a> But that's purely speculation as she has never explicitly supported that view.


## Politics in the Tragic Kingdom

Stefani is a Democrat. She's not the most political rock star around, but she's paid her dues to Obama, most notably during his 2012 re-election campaign.

Stefani hosted an Obama fundraiser at her house in Beverly Hills. The event was attended by first lady Michelle Obama and was billed as a children's event featuring balloon animals, face painting, and moms with their kids. Oh, and it cost anywhere between $2,500 and $25,000 to get in.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/michelle-obama-fundraising-barack-gwen-stefani-barry-meyer-jay-leno-361149" title="Michelle Obama Kicks Off L.A. Fundraising Tour at Gwen Stefani&apos;s House">[4]</a>

Stefani tweeted before the event:

>Getting ready for Michelle Obama to come for a playdate.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/OTUS/gwen-stefani-obama/story?id=16993824#.UDu0Z0Q1at8" title="Gwen Stefani Goes for Obama">[5]</a>

How adorable! A presidential playdate!

On the liberal front, Stefani stands strong. She designed a pair of children's t-shirts with messages supporting same-sex marriage. Shockingly, department store Target picked up the controversial line and sold it at their stores.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://engagefamilyminute.com/2012/05/video-target-youtube-and-same-sex-marriage/" title="Video: Target, YouTube and Same Sex &quot;Marriage.&quot;">[6]</a> 100% of profits from the shirts goes to an organization promoting marriage equality called the Family Equality Council.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://minnesotaforequality.com/tag/gwen-stefani/" title="Gwen Stefani – Minnesota Marriage Amendment.">[7]</a>
