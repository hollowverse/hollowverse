Alec Baldwin was born and raised on Long Island, New York.

He was raised in a Roman Catholic family, and continues to be a devoted Catholic to this day. He married his second wife–apparently the priests were willing to forgive his divorce–at a Catholic church in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/01/fashion/weddings/hilaria-thomas-alec-baldwin-weddings.html?_r=0" title="Hilaria Thomas, Alec Baldwin.">[1]</a> And he is reportedly a generous donor to his church on Long Island.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebitchy.com/category/alec_baldwin/" title="Alec Baldwin.">[2]</a>

He seems to credit God with his professional success. When asked what God is to him, he said,

>It's the voice inside me that controls my instincts, the instincts that got me very very far.<a class="source-citation" href="http://on.aol.com/video/alec-baldwin-on-god-517436340" title="Alec Baldwin on God.">[3]</a>

But Baldwin's strong personality and anger issues don't always endear him to the Catholic church. He angered Catholics when he said to a photographer who was annoying him, "I know you got raped by a priest or something."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.catholicleague.org/alec-baldwin-libels-priests/" title="Alec Baldwin Libels Priests.">[4]</a> And then when he was kicked off an airplane for refusing to turn off his phone, he called the flight attendants "retired Catholic school gym teachers from the 1950′s."<a class="source-citation" href="http://sistertoldjah.com/archives/2011/12/07/moron-alec-baldwin/" title="Alec Baldwin: &quot;Catholic 50s gym teacher&quot; flight attendent singled me out or something.">[5]</a>

Some of his fellow congregants at the church where he spends so much of his money don't appreciate his antics either. While he was reading from the pulpit one Sunday, some members stood up and turned their backs to the actor.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebitchy.com/category/alec_baldwin/" title="Alec Baldwin.">[6]</a>

But he's not going anywhere. Whether they love him or hate him, it looks like Alec Baldwin, Catholic, is here to stay.


## Racist, money-grubbing, lying thieves

If you've ever seen the show 30 Rock, imagine the politics of Baldwin's character Jack Donaghy. Baldwin's views are exactly the opposite. He is a dedicated liberal, both vocally and financially. Since 1989, he has donated more than $144,202 to liberal candidates and committees.<a class="source-citation" href="http://newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Alec_Baldwin.php" title="Alec Baldwin&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[7]</a> That's more money than the average American makes in three years.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/AWI.html" title="National Average Wage Index.">[8]</a>

If there's a hot topic in politics, chances are Baldwin has voiced his liberal–or more accurately anti-Republican–opinion about it. During Barack Obama's re-election campaign in 2012 he sent out tweets calling Republicans "lying thieves"<a class="source-citation" href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/05/alec-baldwin-warns-of-lying-thieves-in-the-white-house-if-obama-loses/" title="Alec Baldwin Warns of &apos;Lying Thieves In the White House&apos; If Obama Loses.">[9]</a> and claiming that if "Obama was white, he'd be up by 17 points."<a class="source-citation" href="http://washington.cbslocal.com/2012/09/04/alec-baldwin-if-obama-was-white-hed-be-up-by-17-points/" title="Alec Baldwin: &apos;If Obama Was White, He&apos;d Be Up By 17 Points.&apos;">[10]</a>

He has voiced his support for gay marriage<a class="source-citation" href="http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2010/10/20/alec-baldwin-campaigns-for-gay-marriage/" title="Alec Badwin Campaigns For Gay Marriage.">[11]</a> and stricter gun control measures,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.discoverthenetworks.org/individualProfile.asp?indid=1120" title="Alec Baldwin.">[12]</a> and his opposition to the Iraq War.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/the-republican-way-keepin_b_369123.html" title="Alec Baldwin: The Republican Way: Keeping Everything The Way It Is.">[13]</a> He stated in a column for the Huffington Post (for which he is a regular contributor), that Republicans were only opposing the Affordable Care Act (or Obamacare) because it would cut down on campaign contributions from insurance companies:

>Health care reform means less money for insurance companies. Thus less money for the GOP. We should pass this bill for that reason alone.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/alec-baldwin/the-republican-way-keepin_b_369123.html" title="Alec Baldwin: The Republican Way: Keeping Everything The Way It Is.">[14]</a>

He is also a strong advocate for animal rights, working with PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) to further the cause. They even named a rescued animal after him and his bride as a wedding present in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/tags/Alec+Baldwin/default.aspx" title="PETA&apos;s Gift for Alec Baldwin and Hilaria Thomas.">[15]</a>

Much to the disdain of Republicans, Baldwin hasn't ruled out running for office some time in the future.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.capitalnewyork.com/article/politics/2012/04/5720270/alec-baldwin-still-wants-run-something-if-democrat-gets-out-way" title="Alec Baldwin still wants to run for something, if a Democrat gets out of the way.">[16]</a> We'll have to wait and see if he's as effective at furthering the liberal agenda as a politician as he is at pissing people off as an actor.
