Robert Redford was born in Santa Monica, California and raised in Van Nuys, California.

It is unclear if religion was present much during his childhood, but considering his Irish/Scottish/English heritage,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000602/bio" title="Robert Redford – Biography">[1]</a> it's reasonable to assume some sort of Christian background. However, as a youth, Redford was involved in street gangs, petty theft and general hooliganism,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.express.co.uk/news/showbiz/259284/Robert-Redford-My-childhood-of-crime" title="Robert Redford: My Childhood of Crime">[2]</a> so it seems unlikely he was devoted to any formal religious/moral framework.

As an adult, Redford is wary of religion. He said:

>I don't believe in organized religion, because I don't believe people should be organized in how they think, in what they believe.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">[3]</a>

But he does seem to, at some point in his life, have taken up a spiritual quest. Redford has said he has "explored every religion, some very deeply" but that there's "there's not one philosophy that can satisfy [him]."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">[4]</a> And when it comes to the great cosmological questions, like "What happens after we die," Redford is skeptical:

>Is there an afterlife? As far as I know, this is it. It's all we've got. You take your opportunities and you go for it.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">[5]</a>

I'd say this puts Redford in the agnostic category, perhaps bordering on atheist. He did, however, marry a Mormon woman<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/movies/actor_boxoffice_stars.html" title="Religion of Top Box Office Stars (Actors)">[6]</a> and lives and works in Utah (the seat of Mormonism), which has played into his political views–which we'll get into later.


## How about now?

Redford is a highly political person–an activist even–whose primary focus is environmentalism. He sits on the board of directors of the National Resources Defense Council<a class="source-citation" href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/eshope/actor_and_nrdc_board_member_ro.html" title="Actor and NRDC Board Member Robert Redford: Join Hands Around the White House on November 6 to Tell President Obama No to Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline">[7]</a> and has won numerous awards for his environmental activity.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foreverwildfilm.com/robertredford.html" title="Robert Redford">[8]</a> As early as the 70s, Redford was pushing for legislation like the Clean Air Act and the Energy Conservation and Production Act,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foreverwildfilm.com/robertredford.html" title="Robert Redford">[9]</a> and he continues to protest projects that threaten the environment such as the Keystone XL Pipeline<a class="source-citation" href="http://switchboard.nrdc.org/blogs/eshope/actor_and_nrdc_board_member_ro.html" title="Actor and NRDC Board Member Robert Redford: Join Hands Around the White House on November 6 to Tell President Obama No to Keystone XL Tar Sands Pipeline">[10]</a> and coal plants in southern Utah.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foreverwildfilm.com/robertredford.html" title="Robert Redford">[11]</a>

This does not necessarily translate to alignment with the Democrats. While a little more than half of Redford's nearly $50,000 in campaign contributions has gone to Democrats, he has supported Republicans as well.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Robert_Redford.php" title="Robert Redford&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[12]</a> And in 2011, Redford penned a piece for the Huffington Post in which he slammed the Obama administration for not sticking to its word regarding environmental issues. He wrote:

>One reason I supported President Obama is because he said we must protect clean air, water and lands. But what good is it to say the right thing unless you act on it?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-redford/keystone-epa-obama-2012_b_947515.html" title="Robert Redford: Is The Obama Administration Putting Corporate Profits Above Public Health">[13]</a>

But, Redford dislikes what he sees as the Republican Party's connection to religion and has complained about George W. Bush claiming to receive guidance from God while in office<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebatheists.com/wiki/Robert_Redford" title="Robert Redford">[14]</a> as well as Mitt Romney using slick rhetoric he learned as a Mormon missionary to sway votes in his favor.<a class="source-citation" href="http://bompolitic.wordpress.com/2007/11/09/robert-redford-knows-all-about-mormons-and-mitt-romney/" title="Robert Redford knows all about Mormons and Mitt Romney">[15]</a>

Also, Redford is also known to be an admirer of famous anarchist Edward Abbey.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/redford-goes-ron-paul/" title="Redford Goes Ron Paul">[16]</a> So, ultimately, he's difficult to pin down. Redford seems to be the type of political mind that realizes solutions can't be found in one ideology vs. another–though his critiques of America's foreign policy,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.sfgate.com/entertainment/article/Robert-Redford-s-Lions-for-Lambs-takes-on-Iraq-3301489.php" title="Robert Redford&apos;s &apos;Lions for Lambs&apos; takes on Iraq War">[17]</a> Republicans and his commitment to environmentalism generally puts him in the liberal category.
