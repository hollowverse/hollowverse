Jean-Claude Van Damme, whose real name is Jean-Claude Camille François Van Varenberg, was born and raised in Berchem-Sainte-Agathe, Brussels, Belgium.

Van Damme is a devout Roman Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nndb.com/people/807/000025732/" title="Jean-Claude Van Damme.">[1]</a> He'd be happy to talk to you about how much God means to him too. In an emotional rant about how he will come back from a mid-career loss of prestige, Van Damme talks about how much God means to him:

>Without God I'm nothing. . . . It's because of God I'm gonna win this fight. I'll show you God exists.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_1P2FIowi0" title="Jean Claude Van Damme – Tears, Passion and God.">[2]</a>

He also credits God with creating his body, although he'll take credit for the work it took to maintain it.

>God gave me a great body and it's my duty to take care of my physical temple.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/j/jean_claude_van_damme.html" title="Jean Claude Van Damme Quotes.">[3]</a>

## Van Damme's biggest orgasm

Apparently Van Damme also sees it as his duty to take care of animals. He really really loves animals. After talking about how he adopted seven seriously injured dogs from Thailand, one of which he bought a doggie wheelchair for, he said this about his pets,

>My biggest orgasm – not in a sexual way – is to walk with my dogs on the beach. In Belgium we have these wide sidewalks. You feel like you're on the Planet Moon, and I can make them feel like movie stars.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000241/bio" title="Jean-Claude Van Damme – Biography.">[4]</a>

Aw… isn't that cute? And just a little bit weird. But hey, he's a sensitive guy. He doesn't just love his pets, either. He's an activist for all kinds of animals' rights, getting props from People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) for his work.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.peta.org/b/thepetafiles/archive/2007/08/13/Jean-Claude-Van-Damme-for-the-Bulls.aspx" title="Jean Claude Van Damme for the Bulls.">[5]</a>

In 2011 Van Damme appeared on a large billboard in Brussels, Belgium holding a skinned mink in association with Global Action in the Interest of Animals (GAIA), an animal anti-cruelty organization.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.mnn.com/lifestyle/arts-culture/blogs/jean-claude-van-damme-fights-fur-industry" title="Jean-Claude Van Damme fights fur industry.">[6]</a>

## Gay people like me for me

He also doesn't seem to care whether his fans are gay or straight, as long as they're fans.

>Most gay people are very tasty people – they like beautiful stuff in their lives. If they like me, it means they have taste. They don't follow me for my butt shots. They like me for me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.towleroad.com/2011/08/jean-claude-van-damme-on-gay-fans-they-have-taste.html" title="Jean-Claude Van Damme On Gay Fans: They Have Taste.">[7]</a>

No word yet, though, on whether or not he thinks his tasty fans have the right to marry each other.

Despite all these potentially liberal tendencies, Van Damme appears on several lists of Hollywood Republicans.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/chat/1311976/posts" title="List of Republican Celebrities.">[8]</a> Considering he hasn't donated to any American political party or endorsed any candidates, that's still up for debate.

No word yet on how he feels about the politics in his home country. Unless of course it has to do with animal rights. He loves animals no matter what country they're from.
