Kelly Ripa was born in Stratford, New Jersey and grew up in Camden County, New Jersey.

Ripa's parents are of Irish and Italian descent,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0727961%2Fbio" title="Kelly Ripa – Biography">[1]</a> so it's safe to assume her Catholicism<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nndb.com%2Fpeople%2F504%2F000047363%2F" title="Kelly Ripa">[2]</a> is a family affair. She appears to have had a religious upbringing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Ffamily%2Fcelebrity-interviews%2Fkelly-ripa-interview-4" title="Kelly Ripa: Fab at 40">[3]</a> To add to that, she married a half-Italian man, Mark Consuelos.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0727961%2Fbio" title="Kelly Ripa – Biography">[4]</a> The couple and their three children keep Catholicism alive as much as possible. The family goes to church most Sundays and they pray often.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Ffamily%2Fcelebrity-interviews%2Fkelly-ripa-interview-4" title="Kelly Ripa: Fab at 40">[5]</a> Ripa has said:

>We grew up Catholic. We've both found it a stabilizing force, a source of strength and comfort in our lives. While we don't always say grace at meals, we do say our prayers every night.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goodhousekeeping.com%2Ffamily%2Fcelebrity-interviews%2Fkelly-ripa-interview-4" title="Kelly Ripa: Fab at 40">[6]</a>

Ripa also supports the organization, Catholic Charities, though it appears to be somewhat minimal. Here's a [photo](http://www.ccbq.org/news/02-02-2012/celebrity-tv-talk-show-host-kelly-ripa-meets-ccbq) of her during a meeting with the Catholic Charities' Office of Development and Communication.

Beyond that, Ripa's not the type to tout God or religious principles on her show or for the media. So, very simply, Catholic it is.


## You can be neutral all you want, but the Hollowverse has got your number

Ripa being the media personality, quasi-journalist, pop culture commentator that she is, taking political positions is tantamount to career suicide. Her morning show is popular in a wide range of demographics and it wouldn't be wise for her to express any particular political viewpoint.

Her position has afforded her the opportunity to interview and co-host with people from across the socio-political landscape. She's interviewed Mitt and Ann Romney<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F09%2F14%2Fmitt-romney-kelly-ripa_n_1884436.html" title="Mitt, Ann Romney Give Interview To Kelly Ripa And Michael Strahan">[7]</a> as well as Michelle Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fdanshamptons.com%2F2012%2F10%2F25%2Fmichelle-obama-gets-questioned-by-kelly-ripa%2F" title="Michelle Obama Gets Questioned By Kelly Ripa">[8]</a> Both interviews only scratched the surface of any political issue and certainly didn't find Ripa interjecting any opinions. What can we say? She's a professional.

However, Ripa has spoken very highly of her parents and upbringing:

>My parents were like June and Ward Cleaver; there was nothing dysfunctional about them.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brainyquote.com%2Fquotes%2Fauthors%2Fk%2Fkelly_ripa.html" title="Kelly Ripa Quotes">[9]</a>

During her childhood, her father, Joseph Ripa, was a labor union organizer and president.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.filmreference.com%2Ffilm%2F98%2FKelly-Ripa.html" title="Kelly Ripa Biography (1970-)">[10]</a> And in 2009, he ran, and won, the position as the Camden County Freeholder,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2009%2F06%2F03%2Fjoe-ripa-kelly-ripas-fath_n_210733.html" title="Joe Ripa, Kelly Ripa&apos;s Father, To Be Sworn Into NJ Public Office">[11]</a> also known as Democratic County Clerk. Basically, she comes from a very active Democrat family and I don't see her breaking rank.

There have been controversies, naturally. When co-hosting her show with gay singer, Clay Aiken, Ripa became very upset when Aiken jokingly covered her mouth during taping. Members of the gay community (mostly Rosie O'Donnel) accused her anger of being homophobic, allegations Ripa vehemently denied.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D13p-95DTgSA" title="The View, Kelly Ripa responds">[12]</a>

But really, for a star of Ripa's magnitude, she does a pretty good job of staying uncontroversial.
