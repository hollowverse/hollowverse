Luisana Lopilato was born and raised in Buenos Aires, Argentina.

The only source (in English) I can find about Lopilato's religious beliefs is suspect and has the word "Lollipop" in the title, so we'll move forward–but with more than a grain of salt.

According to Chloe Lollipop's Blog, Lopilato is a devout Catholic. God comes out in many of her conversations. She once said:

>I believe very much in God, I'm strict Catholic and I pray every day and makes me feel better!<a class="source-citation" href="http://chloe-lollipop-s-blo.pblogs.gr/2011/10/luisana-lopilato.html" title="Luisana Lopilato">[1]</a>

She also credits God to her success as an actress and says if she had the chance, she would thank God for "all the opportunities He has given me."<a class="source-citation" href="http://chloe-lollipop-s-blo.pblogs.gr/2011/10/luisana-lopilato.html" title="Luisana Lopilato">[2]</a>

In 2010, Lopilato married crooner Michael Bublé in a "religious" ceremony in Argentina.<a class="source-citation" href="http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/57956639.html?thread=9939507743" title="Michael Buble and Luisana Lopilato continue their Marriage celebrations">[3]</a> Considering Bublé is also (sort of) a Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="http://hollowverse.com/michael-buble/" title="Michael Bublé&apos;s Religion and Political Views">[4]</a> we can assume it was a Catholic ceremony.


## Liberal Lopilato

What political commentary Lopilato might have dropped on the world is probably masked behind a thick veil of Español, and I am not qualified to translate it.

However, Argentina boasts a rather liberal society. Not only did it legalize marijuana for personal use in 2009,<a class="source-citation" href="http://narcosphere.narconews.com/notebook/kristin-bricker/2009/09/argentina-legalizes-personal-marijuana-use" title="Argentina Legalizes Personal Marijuana Use">[5]</a> but they legalized same-sex marriage in 2010.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/16/world/la-fg-argentina-gays-20100716" title="Argentina Legalizes Gay Marriage">[6]</a> Rumor has it that initially, Lopilato and Bublé had planned, out of protest, to hold off on their marriage until gay marriage was legalized, but that didn't work out.<a class="source-citation" href="http://hollywoodhiccups.com/2011/03/31/michael-buble-married-luisana-loreley-lopilato-de-la-torre-wedding-photo/" title="Michael Bublé Married Luisana Loreley Lopilato">[7]</a> What isn't clear is if they meant Canada (where Bublé is from) or what.
