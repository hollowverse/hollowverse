Lena Headey was born in Bermuda. She was raised there and in Huddersfield, West Yorkshire, England.

Headey doesn't appear to be religiously devoted to any particular faith, but she has more than a passing interest in some eastern philosophies, particularly Buddhism. While she was taking a course on yoga instruction, someone gave her a book on Tibetan Buddhism which, she said, "I love but find quite frightening."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/arts/article2412238.ece" title="My cultural life: Lena Headey.">[1]</a> It would have been lovely if she had elaborated, but alas, we'll have to take what we can get.

Whether or not that was her introduction to Buddhism, she takes it seriously enough to tattoo one of its symbols on her body. She said about the large red lotus flower on her back that she was "always seeking to find some place of self acceptance."<a class="source-citation" href="http://lena-headey.com/information/tattoos.php" title="Tattoos.">[2]</a> Again, a bit cryptic. In an attempt to get a little deeper, the red lotus flower in Tibetan Buddhism represents the purity of the heart, love, compassion, and passion.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.religionfacts.com/buddhism/symbols/lotus.htm" title="Buddhist Lotus Symbol.">[3]</a>

I couldn't find any interviews where she waxed on about how Buddhism has changed her life or how she finds time to meditate every day despite her busy schedule, so I can't be sure that she actively practices. But in terms of a life philosophy, it seems like she's on the Buddhist bandwagon.


## Liberal by Default

About politics, however, it doesn't appear that she has even a passing interest–or at least that's what she makes it seem like in public. No mention of the political scene in the country of her birth, or the U.S. where she currently lives and works. She's not as dedicated to her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/IAMLenaHeadey) as many celebrities, so we don't have the constant window into her consciousness that we do with some. But still, not any passing remarks or interview responses there either.

The one issue about which she seems passionate however, makes her sound just as left-leaning as the rest of Hollywood. Her interest in animal rights moved her to join PETA in a campaign against animal cruelty in circuses.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.peta.org/tv/videos/psas-animals-in-entertainment/822802390001.aspx" title="Lena Headey: Circus Cruelty.">[4]</a>

It's not much, but without anything else to go on, we'll have to lump her into the liberal category for now. Do you know anything else about Headey that we missed? Let us know in the comments.
