Eddie Murphy was born in Brooklyn, New York and grew up there and in Roosevelt, New York.

Murphy was raised a Baptist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Eddie_Murphy.html" title="The religion of Eddie Murphy, actor, comedian">[1]</a> He doesn't talk about it much, if at all. But apparently it was still a force in his life as of 1993, when his first marriage took place at the Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Eddie_Murphy.html" title="The religion of Eddie Murphy, actor, comedian">[2]</a>

Murphy's mother, who is either in denial and blinded by a mother's love or has the inside scoop, says that Eddie is a deeply religious person, saying:

>Eddie is a firm believer in God and prayer. That's probably why he's so hot today.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Eddie_Murphy.html" title="The religion of Eddie Murphy, actor, comedian">[3]</a>

She went on to say that Murphy prays every night and insists that his often vulgar and sexually explicit comedy routines are merely an act and that Eddie is really a nice boy at heart.

Murphy did once star in a film, called Holy Man, in which his character's religiosity and charisma allow him to become a star on a home shopping television network.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120701/" title="Holy Man (1998)">[4]</a> Perhaps this was Murphy's comment on religion–it is merely a show to advance consumerism and commercialization. Some critics came to that conclusion as well.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pm/Eddie_Murphy.html" title="The religion of Eddie Murphy, actor, comedian">[5]</a>

## Race politics

Murphy's work has often had an element of race politics, from playing a satirical "Buckwheat" on Saturday Night Live<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgFDv_4oKsw" title="Eddie Murphy – Saturday Night Live. – Buckwheat">[6]</a> to a homeless black man sticking it to white corporate magnates in his film Trading Places to playing a black politician/con-man in The Distinguished Gentleman.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0104114/plotsummary" title="The Distinguished Gentleman (1992)">[7]</a> Plus, in real life, he's a supporter of the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/eddie-murphy" title="Eddie Murphy&apos;s Charity Work, Events and Causes">[8]</a>

But he never really came out to endorse a candidate until–you guessed it–Obama came along. In a successful career spanning over 30 years, Murphy never contributed money to any candidate's campaign until 2008, when he gave Obama over $30,000.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Eddie_Murphy.php" title="Eddie Murphy&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[9]</a> I wonder why.

But other than expressing excitement that Obama won the 2008 election,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xougvc_eddie-murphy-parties-for-obama-at-one_fun" title="Eddie Murphy Parties For Obama at One">[10]</a> he wasn't vocal about it–or anything else for that matter.
