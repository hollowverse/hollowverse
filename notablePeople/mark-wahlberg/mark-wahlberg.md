Mark Wahlberg was born in Boston, Massachusetts.

Wahlberg's childhood was rough. He was doing time by 16 years of age for assault and battery.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.biography.com/people/mark-wahlberg-9542335" title="Mark Wahlberg Biographay – Facts, Birthday, Life Story">[1]</a>

However, Wahlberg escaped the streets and turned his life around to become an incredibly famous and successful entertainer–as we know–and much of that he credits to his faith. Wahlberg is a devout Catholic, who literally goes to church every day.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://freedomeden.blogspot.com/2012/01/mark-wahlberg-catholic-servant-of-god.html" title="Mark Wahlberg: Catholic, Servant of God">[2]</a> He has said:

>Being a Catholic is the most important aspect of my life. The first thing I do when I start my day is, I get down on my hands and knees and give thanks to God. Whenever I go outside of my house, the first thing I do is stop at the church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.catholic.org/ae/celebrity/story.php?id=39731" title="Mark Wahlberg: &apos;The first thing I do each day is pray.&apos;">[3]</a>

What could a millionaire actor have to pray about? Wahlberg says:

>I pray to be a good servant to God, a father, a husband, a son, a friend, a brother and uncle, a good neighbor, a good leader to those who look up to me and a good follower to those that are serving God and doing the right thing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.theblaze.com/stories/i-go-to-church-every-day-actor-mark-wahlberg-credits-faith-for-turning-his-life-around/" title="Mark Wahlberg Discusses Faith, Church, Prayer &amp; More With Piers Morgan">[4]</a>

It seems that religion has humbled Wahlberg where many in his position would not feel the need for restraint or humility. Kudos.


## Politics

Wahlberg knows what it's like to be the underdog–as a young hoodlum on the streets of Boston and as a human in a world governed by apes, where humans were second-class citizens at best. This experience has colored Wahlberg's political views. Look how he gets you with this quote:

>My politics are about kids who grew up in places like me. I am concerned with the environment, but I'm a lot more concerned about the environment in the inner city that doesn't have any trees or marshes to save.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thearizonan.com/2012/01/09/political-theatre/" title="Political Theater.">[5]</a>

Wahlberg backs it up with his charity work, which includes charities for the homeless<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_-_NXReiXtU&feature=player_embedded" title="Mark Wahlberg on How He Helps the Homeless and His New Movie Directed by Seth McFarlane">[6]</a> as well as a foundation for helping underprivileged youth.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/charity/382-the-mark-wahlberg-youth-foundation" title="The Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation: Celebrity Supporters">[7]</a>

But at the end of the day, Wahlberg is a Democrat, having donated all of his campaign contribution money so far to Democratic presidential candidates, including Obama in 2008.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Mark_Wahlberg.php" title="Mark Wahlberg&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[8]</a> He seems to be a supporter for Obama's 2012 campaign as well.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BfzRAt4r7k" title="Mark Wahlberg Hopes For Obama&apos;s Change">[9]</a>
