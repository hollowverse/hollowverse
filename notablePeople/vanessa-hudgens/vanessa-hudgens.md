Vanessa Hudgens was born in Salinas, California and grew up in various places along the U.S. west coast.

Hudgens comes from a very ethnically diverse family. Her father is part Native American, part Irish. Her mother is part Filipino, part Chinese, and part Spanish. Her religious upbringing could have gone a lot of different ways. But Hudgens was brought up Roman Catholic, which she doesn't talk about much, except to justify her fashion accessories, saying:

>I'm a jewellery addict. I love it and could load it on all day. I'm Catholic, so that's why I have two crosses on.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/vanessa-hudgens-my-young-fans-409286" title="Vanessa Hudgens: &apos;My young fans have put me off having kids!&apos;">[1]</a>

Still, she seems rather devout and is frequently spotted by paparazzi leaving or entering a Catholic church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aC0tiyCuV40" title="Vanessa Hudgens Leaving St. Charles Borromeo Catholic Church in North Hollywood.">[2]</a> But don't think she's a good, religiously conservative, prudish girl. Perhaps Hudgens' greatest career challenge has been justifying away and trying to deflect attention from the numerous nude photo scandals she's been involved with.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/vanessa-hudgens-upset-and-angered-by-nude-pics-leak-2011163" title="Vanessa Hudgens &quot;Upset and Angered&quot; by Nude Pics Leak">[3]</a>

But as one commentator rightly asked:

>What kind of catholic would Vanessa be without a naughty streak?<a class="source-citation" href="#http://pacificcoastnewsonline.celebuzz.com/2008/12/vanessa-hudgens-is-a-good-litt.html" title="Vanessa Hudgens Is a Good Little Catholic Girl">[4]</a>

## Political emptiness

Hudgens hasn't gotten into politics, not even enough to endorse Barack Obama like a good little Hollywood liberal should do. But given her penchant for nudity, maybe she'd be more suited to the politics of European beaches.

One can reasonably speculate that Hudgens is quite liberal. She's been busted making out with girls, for one.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CuiCxLZfxHw" title="Vanessa Hudgens&apos; Lesbian Kiss! – The Dirt TV.">[5]</a> And second of all, she's totally down with gays, saying:

>I do have a bunch of gay friends, my hairstylist is gay, and my makeup artist in New York is gay — just lots of people in my life that I love.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/film/2011/03/04/vanessa-hudgens-punching-beauty" title="Vanessa Hudgens: Punching Beauty">[6]</a>

Beyond that, she's made no statement about her political or social views. She does, however, support various charities–particularly children's charities.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/2235-vanessa-hudgens" title="Vanessa Hudgens&apos;s Charity Work, Events and Causes">[7]</a> So, we could argue that she cares about a better society.
