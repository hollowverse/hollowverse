Lexi Belle was born in Independence, Louisiana and grew up there, in McComb, Mississippi, and in Burbank, California.

We don't know much about Lexi Belle's religious beliefs. I could imagine that it would be hard to reconcile most mainstream religions to the life of a porn star, but it certainly takes all kinds.

We know that she's not Jewish because she made a comment about how Adam Sandler wouldn't want to "hook up" with her because she doesn't share his faith.<a class="source-citation" href="http://tour.naughtyamerica.com/porn-star-interviews/lexi-belle-porn-star-interview/2620/" title="Lexi Belle Porn Star Interview.">[1]</a>

It seems like she has a little bit of a Christian background because she said that the reason she did not have anal sex on screen was that she was saving her asshole for Jesus.<a class="source-citation" href="http://loomings.weebly.com/interview-with-lexi-belle.html" title="Interview with Lexi Belle.">[2]</a> I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that she doesn't really believe that she and Jesus are going to be getting it on in heaven. So I think the jury's still out on this porn star's religion.

Lexi doesn't give us too many clues about her political leanings either, but I'm going to go with liberal. As a bisexual woman,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.lexibelle.com/lexibellebio.php" title="More Information about Lexi Belle.">[3]</a> she understandably has a stake in the same-sex marriage debate. When asked the first thing she would do if she were President of the U.S., she said,

>Legalize gay marriage!<a class="source-citation" href="http://tour.naughtyamerica.com/porn-star-interviews/lexi-belle-porn-star-interview/2620/" title="Lexi Belle Porn Star Interview.">[4]</a>

But that's about all we have to go on for Lexi so far. If you have any insight for us, please feel free to let us know in the comments!
