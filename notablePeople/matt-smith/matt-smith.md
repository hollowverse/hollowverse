Matt Smith was born and raised in Northampton, England, United Kingdom

There is no information to be found about Smith's religious upbringing, if there was one. The majority of the UK's inhabitants are Christian, though a recent poll found that only 34% of them definitely believe in "God."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Belief" title="Religion in the United Kingdom">[1]</a>

Smith appears to be in the 66% that doesn't definitely believe in God. Furthermore, he's in the 20% that doesn't "believe there is any sort of spirit, God or life force."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_the_United_Kingdom#Belief" title="Religion in the United Kingdom">[2]</a> He once said:

>I recently read ,The God Delusion, by Richard Dawkins, which ignited my interest in a scientific, mathematical version of the world. No, I'm not religious. At all. I'm an atheist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2011/dec/03/matt-smith-interview-lord-misrule" title="Matt Smith interview: lord of misrule">[3]</a>

Well, that settles it. Moving on.


## My politics are irrelevant–but not really

Smith was asked in 2011 which party or candidate he would vote for in the upcoming UK elections. He said that information was "irrelevant."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beehivecity.com/television/doctor-who-matt-smith-appeals-to-charismatic-cameron-to-reverse-arts-cuts3456780/" title="Doctor Who&apos;s Matt Smith appeals to &apos;charismatic&apos; Cameron to halt Arts cuts">[4]</a>

Nevertheless, Smith indicates strong leanings toward the Labour Party's advocacy of state-funded programs of all kinds, though Smith seems particularly concerned with the arts and drama. He said of arts programs budget cuts that were sweeping the UK:

>I like the arts so it's something that I want to see supported [by the government]. And I think it's something that develops communities and lives and ideas and perspective and all the things in life that can broaden you. I think art is about risk.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beehivecity.com/television/doctor-who-matt-smith-appeals-to-charismatic-cameron-to-reverse-arts-cuts3456780/" title="Doctor Who&apos;s Matt Smith appeals to &apos;charismatic&apos; Cameron to halt Arts cuts">[5]</a>

About the National Health Service (NHS), Britain's socialized medicine agency, Smith similarly said:

>I believe the NHS needs to be protected. It's one of the few organizations in the world like it. It's always been very good to me – because I'm clumsy, frankly.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beehivecity.com/television/doctor-who-matt-smith-appeals-to-charismatic-cameron-to-reverse-arts-cuts3456780/" title="Doctor Who&apos;s Matt Smith appeals to &apos;charismatic&apos; Cameron to halt Arts cuts">[6]</a>

It seems all about Big Government to Smith. Still, he had nothing but kind words after attending an event where Conservative Prime Minister, David Cameron, spoke:

>I was struck by the polish, which I'm sure he's been well trained on. It's quite a skill. He was very charismatic…<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.beehivecity.com/television/doctor-who-matt-smith-appeals-to-charismatic-cameron-to-reverse-arts-cuts3456780/" title="Doctor Who&apos;s Matt Smith appeals to &apos;charismatic&apos; Cameron to halt Arts cuts">[7]</a>

That comment seems to be more about the admiration of one performer to another. So, irrelevant or not, Smith is probably more a Labour supporter than anything else.
