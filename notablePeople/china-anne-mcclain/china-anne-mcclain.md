China Anne McClain was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up a child actor doing auditions in Los Angeles, California, Chicago, Illinois and various other places. Considering that, at the time of this article's publication, McClain is 15 years-old, we could say she's still growing up in L.A.

McClain is a Christian.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.allstarpics.net/pic-gallery/china-anne-mcclain-pics.htm" title="China Anne McClain Pics">[1]</a> Exactly what denomination is up in the air, though there does seem to be some consensus among question and answer websites that she is a Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ask.com/answers/89676061/what-religion-is-china-anne-mcclain" title="What religion is China Anne McClain">[2]</a>

Regardless, she has stated that one of her favorite "hobbies" is going to church with her family,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1942207/bio" title="China Anne McClain – Biography.">[3]</a> so we can assume she's fairly devout.

Then there's the connections to religion in her career. Her breakout performance was as a church choir girl in TheGospel,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.facebook.com/pages/China-Anne-McClain/289021817790823?sk=info" title="China Anne McCalain – About">[4]</a> a film that adapted the biblical story of the prodigal son to a modern context.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/the-gospel/" title="The Gospel">[5]</a>

Plus, her stardom really took off when she began working with Tyler Perry,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.tbs.com/stories/story/0,,76347,00.html" title="Tyler Perry&apos;s House of Payne – China Anne McClain">[6]</a> whose religious views permeate everything he produces.

So, we can safely say that Christianity is a powerful force in McClain's life. However, at her young age, it would be unwise to try and pin a label on her. Things can and do change rather quickly for child stars.


## Politics of youth

McClain has yet to be eligible to vote. And in all of her interviews that I have seen, the topic of politics was not breached. However, she appears to be a fan of Obama. She was rather excited to meet Michelle Obama,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.disneydreaming.com/2011/11/10/china-anne-mcclain-doug-brochu-and-chris-brochu-meet-first-lady-michelle-obama/" title="China Anne McClain, Doug Brochu And Chris Brochu Meet First Lady Michelle Obama">[7]</a> she has supportive statements plastered all over her Twitter feed–particularly around the time that the 2012 elections were heating up,<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/realchinaanne" title="China Anne McClain on Twitter">[8]</a> and she played one of Obama's daughters on a skit for Jimmy Kimmel's late night show.

This wouldn't be an explicit show of support except that when McClain posted a video of the skit on their YouTube channel, it came with the disclaimer:

>We adore the Obama's and definitely support them!!<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BLs7ZR2De4" title="McClain Sisters in Jimmy Kimmel Skit (1)">[9]</a>

So let's just pretend McClain isn't a youngster and that this isn't a bit of a ridiculous exercise and say she's a Democrat.
