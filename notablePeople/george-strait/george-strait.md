George Strait was born in Poteet, Texas and grew up in Pearsall, Texas.

Strait is a quiet icon. If you're going to get him talking, the conversation will likely revolve around his music. However, we know he was raised a Baptist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nndb.com/people/225/000025150/" title="George Strait">[1]</a> He did have a religious upbringing, to which he credits his father:

>My dad, of course, raised my brother and me on his own, and he raised us in a real religious atmosphere. We're all Baptists, and he always told me that the Lord would tell me what He wanted me to do with my life; and I kind of believe that's really true. So I didn't worry about it much, didn't think about it that much.<a class="source-citation" href="http://books.google.com/books?id=k3ze2mnY6icC&pg=PA8&lpg=PA8&dq=George+Strait+religion&source=bl&ots=NNYE8_w8C7&sig=TDF2i0lyCbRLguJJGa2Oh8KmbsI&hl=en&sa=X&ei=lhTGULjRJIXliALdy4CoBw&ved=0CEgQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=George%20Strait%20religion&f=false" title="George Strait – Updated page 8">[2]</a>

Strait eloped with his high school sweetheart in Mexico, but when they returned to Texas, they had a ceremony in a church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://kilt.cbslocal.com/2011/11/29/george-and-norma-celebrate-40-years-together/" title="George and Norma Celebrate 40 Years Together">[3]</a> Which church is unclear.

And like most country music stars, he's got a few religious-themed songs in his repertoire, such as "I Saw God Today," with lyrics like:

>I've been to church/I've read the book/I know He's there/But I don't look/near as often as I should/His fingerprints are everywhere/I just look down and stop and stare/open my eyes and then I swear/I Saw God Today.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/I-Saw-God-Today-lyrics-George-Strait/EF866273A3FFA0DA482573FB000EED82" title="I Saw God Today Lyrics – George Strait">[4]</a>

So, despite the fact that Strait doesn't talk about it, we can say with considerable confidence that he's at least somewhat religious, and probably still a Baptist.


## Strait talking politics

It won't happen, folks. In the arena of politics, Strait is even more tight-lipped than he is with his religious views. In 2012, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich used his song, "Heartland," at campaign events–which obviously Strait didn't take issue with.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.countrystandardtime.com/blog/rootstootshoots/entry.asp?xid=843" title="Gingrich, Strait, McBride and country music in campaigns">[5]</a> But when asked to comment about candidates, issues, or anything political for that matter, all reporters could get was a statement from Strait's publicist:

>George never comments publicly on political views.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.countrystandardtime.com/blog/rootstootshoots/entry.asp?xid=843" title="Gingrich, Strait, McBride and country music in campaigns">[6]</a>

OK then…

We have one tiny piece of evidence that suggests that Strait is probably a Republican. In 1992, he donated $240 to the National Republican Senatorial Committee.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/George_Strait.php" title="George Strait&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[7]</a>

Beyond that, plenty of fan sites and rumor mills speculate that he's a Republican,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/chat/1311976/posts" title="List of Republican celebrities">[8]</a> so there must be some reason for that, which might just be he's a country singer from Texas.
