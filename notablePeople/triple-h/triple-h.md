Triple H, whose real name is Paul Levesque, was born and raised in Nashua, New Hampshire.

Some people seem to think Triple H is Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.evi.com%2Fq%2Fwhat_religion_is_triple_h" title="What religion is Triple H?">[1]</a> but I couldn't find any information from the man himself confirming this. On his MySpace page, his religion is listed as "Christian – other,"<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Ftopaullevesque" title="Paul Levesque (Triple H) on Myspace.">[2]</a> which neither confirms nor denies the rumors.

And so it would appear that Triple H is some sort of Christian, but he's either not very religious or he likes to keep it private.

Triple H appears to be a Republican, or at least a supportive son-in-law. He is married to Stephanie McMahon Levesque, the daughter of Linda McMahon, former CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment and Republican politician. During McMahon's unsuccessful 2010 run for Senate in Connecticut, Triple H campaigned for his mother-in-law.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DbuhQz7MfTGU" title="Paul Levesque (aka Triple H) Rallying Support for Linda.">[3]</a>

I couldn't find any evidence that Triple H actively campaigned for McMahon during her 2012 bid for the Connecticut Senate seat, but he did attend that state's Republican convention in 2012 with a few of his in-laws.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wrestlingnewssource.com%2Fnews%2F26497%2FPHOTO-Vince-McMahon-Triple-H-Shane-McMahon-Together%2F" title="PHOTO: Vince McMahon, Triple H, Shane McMahon Together.">[4]</a>

I couldn't find anything else from Triple H about his views on specific issues, but we can suppose until we hear otherwise that they're in line with the Republican platform.
