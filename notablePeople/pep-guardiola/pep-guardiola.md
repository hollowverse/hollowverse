Josep "Pep" Guardiola i Sala was born and raised in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.

I expected Guardiola to be at least mildly Catholic, as I expect of most Spaniards. But I couldn't find a shred of evidence that he even thinks about religion all that much. It seems most likely that he joins the quarter of the population of Spain that considers itself non-religious.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReligion_in_Spain" title="Religion in Spain.">[1]</a> Maybe that's why he has decided to stay in the much more secular New York City for the time being.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestplaces.net%2Freligion%2Fstate%2Fnew_york" title="Religion in New York.">[2]</a>

If any of you readers know anything about Guardiola's religion that I missed, drop us a line in the comments. We appreciate the help.


## One more vote for independence

As far as politics are concerned, Guardiola has a little more to say. He is a strong and vocal advocate for Catalan independence. He grew up in Catalonia, and spent much of his football career, as both a player and coach, with Barcelona's team, and he feels great pride for his home. He said,

>I feel a strong bond to my country, Catalonia. I feel a strong bond to what I feel inside my head and my heart. A country that for 800 years has had its own language. . . so one feels this as part of him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DuHRZgF5myKw" title="Pep Guardiola – Catalonia is not Spain.">[3]</a>

When asked in one interview why he speaks to journalists in Catalan, he responded,

>We are a country with our own language and when we leave its borders, those of us that speak it, use it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goal.com%2Fen%2Fnews%2F12%2Fspain%2F2009%2F12%2F10%2F1678817%2Fbarcelonas-pep-guardiola-incites-political-rift-we-are-our" title="Barcelona&apos;s Pep Guardiola Incites Political Rift – We Are Our Own Country With Our Own Language.">[4]</a>

Although Guardiola was living in New York in 2012, he sent a video message of his support for his country's independence from Spain during a demonstration on the National Day of Catalonia. His message to his fellow Catalans was,

>Here's one more vote for independence.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marca.com%2F2012%2F09%2F12%2Fen%2Ffootball%2Fbarcelona%2F1347470330.html" title="Pep Guardiola: &quot;Here&apos;s one more vote for independence.&quot;">[5]</a>

If Catalonia ever does manage to secede, and gets a place in the World Cup with its national team, there's no doubt that Guardiola will be right there with them, barking directions from the sideline in Catalan.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fuk.eurosport.yahoo.com%2Fblogs%2Fpitchside-europe%2Fbarca-catalyst-catalonia-independent-streak-165604732.html" title="Barca a catalyst for Catalonia&apos;s independent streak.">[6]</a>
