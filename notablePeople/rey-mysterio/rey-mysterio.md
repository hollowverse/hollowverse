Rey Mysterio, whose real name is Oscar Gutierrez, was born and raised in San Diego, California.

Mysterio is of Mexican descent. Considering this, it's not surprising that he is Catholic. What is a bit surprising is his level of devotion to his faith. He has said:

>I pray every night; I'm a believer…<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Finside%2Fsuperstarink%2Farticles%2Freymysterio" title="Rey Mysterio: A Made Man">[1]</a>

Mysterio's most visible displays of faith are his many religious tattoos, including a rosary tattoo around his neck, a cross on his neck and the words "Made Man By God" on his wrists.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Finside%2Fsuperstarink%2Farticles%2Freymysterio" title="Rey Mysterio: A Made Man">[2]</a>

Mysterio credits his success as a wrestler to God, saying he is merely fulfilling the purpose God set out for him:

>I really do believe that personally… that God has a purpose for each and every one of us here on planet Earth. And my purpose was definitely to be a performer, to entertain our fans. I give thanks every day to God for what he has given me and my family because sports entertainment has given me a lot of satisfaction on many levels.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.prowrestling.net%2Fartman%2Fpublish%2FWWE%2Farticle10019536.shtml" title="WWE News: Rey Mysterio talks injuries, high flying moves and the significance of his religious tattoos">[3]</a>

## Ethnic politics

Mysterio is very proud of his Mexican-American heritage. Speaking of the tattoo that sprawls across his stomach that reads "Mexican," he said:

>That is to show my pride, my culture… and it's very important to me. That's who I am.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wwe.com%2Finside%2Fsuperstarink%2Farticles%2Freymysterio" title="Rey Mysterio: A Made Man">[4]</a>

Mysterio has made no explicit political statements that I can find. But, consistent with his pride regarding his heritage, Mysterio weighed in on the contentious debate over immigration–albeit in a roundabout manner.

Mysterio follows, and occasionally retweets messages provided by the Twitter account @NoSB1070. This is an implicit protest against Arizona's anti-illegal immigration law, SB 1070, that many have criticized as a racist, draconian piece of legislation. For example, Mysterio retweeted:

>Help us and Retweet Say Nooo! to Arizona's Anti-Illegal Immigration Law SB1070.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Freymysterioinc" title="Rey Mysterio (reymysterioinc) on Twitter">[5]</a>

It is a bit weak, but does count as a political statement regarding a contentious political debate often pitting liberals against conservatives. In this case, Mysterio sides with the liberals.
