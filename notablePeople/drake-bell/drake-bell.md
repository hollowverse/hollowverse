Jared Drake Bell, better known as just Drake Bell, was born and raised in Santa Ana, California.

The internet really seems to think Bell is a born-again Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.ask.com/answers/81706181/is-drake-bell-a-christian" title="is drake bell a christian.">[1]</a> well except for the occasional Jewish label, which is pretty typical of any celebrity ever.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.chacha.com/question/is-drake-bell-a-christian" title="Is drake bell a christian?">[2]</a> Some even go so far as to say that he wasn't a believer until he went to church with his religious mother, and then he became "born again."<a class="source-citation" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Is_Drake_Bell_Christian" title="Is Drake Bell Christian.">[3]</a>

Trouble is, I couldn't find any evidence to back up those claims. The closest I got to any religious affiliation was the fact that he performed some Christmas songs at an event in Los Angeles.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nickutopia.com/2012/11/09/drake-bell-will-perform-christmas-music-at-universal-city-walk-on-november-20-2012/" title="Drake Bell Will Perform Christmas Music At Universal City Walk On November 20, 2012.">[4]</a> And that's not exactly a devout profession of faith. Even his song "Don't Preach" is entirely secular.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/drakebell/dontpreach.html" title="Drake Bell Lyrics – Don&apos;t Preach.">[5]</a>

So despite the rumors, I think we'll have to call this young actor non-religious for the time being.


## Lukewarm for Obama

Drake Bell appears to be a lukewarm Democrat. He gave a possibly slightly drunk endorsement of Obama outside a bar in L.A. prior to the 2012 presidential election.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CsMuhGNCMZU" title="Drake Bell &amp; Michael Corcoran on Josh Peck &amp; Obama Vs Romney at Bootsy at Bootsy Bellows in West Hollywood.">[6]</a> And then after the election, when asked what he thought about the outcome, he said,

>It's cool I guess, yeah.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mubHSoe-lTg" title="Drake Bell on Obama Win at Bootsy Bellows in LA.">[7]</a>

And then on his Twitter feed,<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/DrakeBell" title="Drake Bell (DrakeBell) on Twitter.">[8]</a> he retweeted a link to [this article](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/robert-j-elisberg/election-results-2012_b_2086123.html) which criticizes the far-right element of the Republican party.

In terms of non-controversial pseudo-political involvement, Bell is a spokesman for the Thirst Project which aims to increase access to clean drinking water to communities across the globe.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thirstproject.org/2009/10/thirst-project-psa-drake-bell/" title="Thirst Project PSA – Drake Bell.">[9]</a>

So we'll tentatively call Bell a Democrat for now, although I suspect there's some opinions beneath the surface that he hasn't let out yet. As soon as he starts getting involved in the political debate, let us know in the comments!
