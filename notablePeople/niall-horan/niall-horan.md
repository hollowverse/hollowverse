Niall Horan was born in Mullingar, County Westmeath, Ireland.

Like most Irish, Horan is Catholic and attended Coláiste Mhuire, an all-boys Catholic school growing up.<a class="source-citation" href="http://niallhorandaily.net/" title="Your Daily Source for everything Niall Horan">[1]</a>

Horan hasn't spoken about his faith so it's impossible to tell the level of his devotion to the Catholic church.

Politically, there is absolutely no clues as to whether Horan would lean more liberal or conservative except for a video of him wearing high-heeled shoes–perhaps a sign that he is somewhat liberal, at least when it comes to cross-dressing?<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.hollywoodlife.com/2012/05/07/niall-horan-one-direction-heels-video/" title="Niall Horan High Heels: One Direction Bandmate Prances In Pumps">[2]</a>
