Heather Graham was born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and grew up in Agoura Hills, California.

Graham is mostly of Irish descent,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.irishcentral.com/ent/Heather-Graham-and-The-Hangover-boys-hit-up-Dublin-48488077.html" title="Heather Graham and &apos;The Hangover&apos; Boys Hit Up Dublin">[1]</a> so naturally she was raised a Catholic, and reports confirm that her upbringing was quite strict.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.parentdish.com/2007/07/26/heather-grahams-parents-think-shes-a-porn-star/" title="Heather Graham&apos;s parents think she&apos;s a porn star">[2]</a> In fact, her parents once threatened to send her to a convent because, as it turns out, she isn't the most devout Catholic girl:

>I'd have made a terrible nun. I'm a good Catholic girl in the way that Madonna is. In the sense that I'm not that good at all. If the church is having a hard time recruiting nuns, I'd make an ideal poster girl. 'Become a nun or else end up like her!'<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1190612/Heather-Graham-good-Catholic-girl-way-Madonna-is.html" title="Heather Graham on being a good Catholic girl (in the way Madonna is)">[3]</a>

So devout are Graham's parents that they even severed contact with her after she played a stripper in the film, Boogie Nights.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.parentdish.com/2007/07/26/heather-grahams-parents-think-shes-a-porn-star/" title="Heather Graham&apos;s parents think she&apos;s a porn star">[4]</a>

Clearly she's no longer a good Catholic girl, and might have replaced that gap with some vaguely Eastern practices, such as tantric sex therapy<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1190612/Heather-Graham-good-Catholic-girl-way-Madonna-is.html" title="Heather Graham on being a good Catholic girl (in the way Madonna is)">[5]</a> and Transcendental Meditation, which, when she appeared on the cover of Time magazine, she was pictured practicing.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001287/bio" title="Heather Graham (I) – Biography">[6]</a>

But, for our purposes, lapsed Catholic.


## Far into left field

Politically, like religiously, Graham has bucked the traditions of her family. She said:

>I… [grew] up in a conservative family and feeling that I was much more liberal-minded… Maybe that's why I had to learn how to love and accept myself as I was, not as they wanted me to be.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=2576" title="Gray Areas: Alan Cumming and Heather Graham on sex, politics, lesbian chic and their new movie &apos;Gray Matters.&apos;">[7]</a>

But to say "more liberal-minded" is a bit of an understatement. She did a PSA for MoveOn.org, one of America's most explicitly liberal organizations. The PSA was meant to encourage support for the "public option," a term referring to the push toward American socialized healthcare.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/23/heather-graham-stars-in-m_n_473101.html" title="Heather Graham Stars in MoveOn Public Option Ad">[8]</a>

Plus, she's got a gay rights agenda and has her environmental concerns–both liberal staple issues:

>Global warming is really disturbing, and I wish we were taking better care of our environment, our planet. Gay rights — it's crazy that we're trying to regulate people. It's so stupid.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=2576" title="Gray Areas: Alan Cumming and Heather Graham on sex, politics, lesbian chic and their new movie &apos;Gray Matters.&apos;">[9]</a>

And, naturally, she's an Obama supporter, who she claims to have helped win office in 2008 by sending out "positive energies."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dnaindia.com/entertainment/report_heather-graham-says-she-helped-obama-become-president-through-witchcraft_1318326" title="Heather Graham says she helped Obama become president through witchcraft">[10]</a> However, I would venture a guess that the $1,000 check she sent his campaign probably did a little more good.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?st=NY&last=Graham&first=Heather" title="Heather Graham&apos;s federal campaign search results">[11]</a>
