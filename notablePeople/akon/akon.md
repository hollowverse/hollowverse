Akon, whose real name is Aliaune Damala Badara Akon Thiam, was born in St Louis, Missouri and grew up in various places including Senegal and Newark, New Jersey.

Akon is a Muslim and uses his religion to justify his claims that he has three wives.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.akonfan.com/biography.html" title="Akon&apos;s Biography">[1]</a> You know, because Muslims can have up to four wives. But considering his raunchy sex party music videos<a class="source-citation" href="#http://lockerz.com/d/7822002" title="Jordan Whitford&apos;s Decalz: I Just Had Sex (feat. Akon)">[2]</a> and controversies involving him and sex acts with underage girls,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thesource4ym.com/musicdiscussions/MusicDiscussions.aspx?id=9" title="Music Discussions: Akon Sorry – Blame it on Me">[3]</a> he's probably not a great husband–or Muslim. But he still finds it in his heart to give a shout-out to Allah in one of his songs, "Senegal," He raps:

>So what you know about how God comes first in our lives, everything that we do is for Allah/So what you know about that Holy place called Touba where Prophets are born/So what you know about comin here, gettin money and investing it back home.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lyrics007.com/Akon%20Lyrics/Senegal%20Lyrics.html" title="Akon – Senegal Lyrics">[4]</a>

Speaking of raunchy sex party music videos, Akon is no friend to Buddhists, at least Buddhists of the Sri Lankan variety. His video for the song "Sexy Chick" featured a statue of Buddha at a wild and crazy dance party where scantily-clad women rubbed up against the singer. Buddhists in Sri Lanka were so offended that Akon was denied a visa to perform in the country. Akon said:

>[I] am a spiritual man, so I can understand why they are offended.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/mar/25/akon-sri-lanka-buddha-statue" title="Akon banned from Sri Lanka for Buddha statue video">[5]</a>

## Stuck in the middle

Akon's politics range from African diamond controversy to attempting to unite disparate U.S. political factions.

Akon is a part-owner of an African diamond mine. It's almost a guarantee that there are some human rights violations going on and Akon has denied that such a thing even exists, saying:

>I don't even believe in conflict diamonds. That's just a movie. Think about it. Ain't nobody thought about nothing about no conflict diamonds until the movie, [,Blood Diamond,], came out. Where was all that shit before the movie?<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/akon-so-what-if-i-own-a-diamond-mine-436472.html" title="Akon: So what if I own a diamond mine?">[6]</a>

Ok…

In the U.S., Akon is a confirmed centrist–not Republican, not Democrat, and pissed off that these politicians can't just get along long enough to get anything done. Hey, aren't we all?

Akon donated a song to a political organization called "No Labels," which attempts to get centrist politicians elected so as to dampen rampant partisanship in U.S. politics. In the song, Akon sings:

>He's a Democrat/ He's Republican/ There's a fight and a race who's gonna win/ put your differences aside 'man up' you can/ 'Cause there's way too many people suffering/ I wish they didn't have 'No Labels'/ There'd be more change with 'No Labels.'<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2010/12/akon-croons-ode-to-political-centrism/18213/" title="Akon Croons Ode to Political Centrism">[7]</a>

He makes a good point. In fact, Akon seems to be rather politically astute–despite his supposed ignorance of conflict diamonds. He once tweeted:

>Politics is the art of postponing a decision until it is no longer relevant!<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/Akon/statuses/162688014236131329" title="Akon: Politics is the art of pos">[8]</a>

Amen.
