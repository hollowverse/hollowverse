Kylie Jenner was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

Despite some assertions that she's Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhat_religion_is_Kylie_Jenner" title="What religion is Kylie Jenner.">[1]</a> Jenner goes to a non-denominational Christian church<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zimbio.com%2Fphotos%2FKendall%2BJenner%2FKardashian%2BFamily%2BLeaving%2BChurch%2BEaster%2BSunday%2FrzjOLaWLimM" title="The Kardashian Family Leaving Church On Easter Sunday.">[2]</a> that her family helped found and which they support.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Ffaithgoespop%2F2012%2F09%2Fa-kardashian-kult-is-more-realistic-than-you-think%2F" title="A Kardashian Kult Is More Realistic Than You Think.">[3]</a>

Kylie's godmother, Kathie Lee Gifford, says the youngest Jenner often talks about her faith.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Ffaithgoespop%2F2012%2F09%2Fa-kardashian-kult-is-more-realistic-than-you-think%2F" title="A Kardashian Kult Is More Realistic Than You Think.">[4]</a> And she told Seventeen magazine that one of her favorite accessories is her "Jesus pieces" or "saint bracelets" which she says wears every day.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.seventeen.com%2Fvideo%2Fkendall-kylies-most-embarrassing-clothes-video-1105453357001" title="Kendall and Kylie&apos;s Most Embarrassing Clothes Video Clip.">[5]</a> Who knows if that's more fashion statement or religious statement, but sometimes those things go hand in hand–especially if you live in the Kardashian/Jenner household.


## Stay tuned for Kylie's politics

Jenner has more important things to worry about than politics–like where she's going to go shopping today and what purse she's going to wear with those shoes. In all seriousness, she really doesn't talk about politics. At all.

The only clue we have to go on is that even though Jenner's parents are hard-core Republicans, Kylie's older half-sister Kim Kardashian said that "all the kids are Democrats."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.politico.com%2Fblogs%2Fclick%2F2012%2F04%2Fkim-kardashian-on-running-for-mayor-stay-tuned-121938.html" title="Kim Kardashian, Democrat, on running for mayor: &apos;Stay tuned.&apos;">[6]</a> We can't be sure that she meant to include her two younger half-sisters in that comment, but it's reasonable to think she did.

Considering this young reality TV star is growing up with cameras filming every facet of her life, we can assume that if she ever does start to form some opinions about politics, we the public will be kept up-to-date.
