Rocco Siffredi, whose name at birth was Rocco Tano, was born in Ortona, Abruzzo, Italy.

Siffredi gives no indication that he is in any way religious. The fact that he is Italian would automatically make me think Catholic, but Catholics (at least the strict ones) are really not into pornography.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pornnomore.com/" title="Welcome.">[1]</a>

I couldn't find any indication that he considers himself an atheist or agnostic either, even though it seems likely that he's had to deal with a fair bit of criticism from religious individuals. So the only logical conclusion I can come to is that he's entirely non-religious. If any of you Rocco Siffredi fans out there have more information, please let us know in the comments.


## Active sexual lives make good politics

Siffredi doesn't shy away from weighing in on Italian politics, at least when it comes to former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi. After the conservative politician was accused of paying an underage woman for sex, along with a slew of other sexually promiscuous behavior, Siffredi came to his defense. He said,

>The truth is that Italians are proud of someone like Berlusconi who is 74, loves sex and has a good sex life â€“ and I don't just mean working-class Italians.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/22/silvio-berlusconi-porn-star-rocco-siffredi" title="Silvio Berlusconi defended by Italian porn star.">[2]</a>

He went on to say he approved of Berlusconi's active sexual life and that he's sure the former prime minister thought the young woman was older than she was.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/22/silvio-berlusconi-porn-star-rocco-siffredi" title="Silvio Berlusconi defended by Italian porn star.">[3]</a>

I couldn't find anything else about Siffredi's political views, so it's tough to say if his defense of Berlusconi was an indication that he's conservative politically, or if he just approves of sexual promiscuity regardless of political affiliation.
