McKayla Maroney was born in Long Beach, California. She grew up there and in Laguna Niguel, California.

Maroney comes from an Irish Catholic family,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ctbulletin.com/articles/2012/08/04/news/doc5014a200daaef465561523.txt" title="Milford watching Olympic gymnast with local ties.">[1]</a> but I couldn't find much indication that she's particularly religious.

The description on her Twitter profile says, "Another Day, Another Blessing From God,"<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/McKaylaMaroney" title="McKayla Maroney (McKaylaMaroney) on Twitter.">[2]</a> which would make her seem particularly devout. And on her Facebook page she wished her fans "a Blessed and Happy Thanksgiving!"<a class="source-citation" href="#https://www.facebook.com/McKaylaMaroneyFans" title="McKayla Maroney.">[3]</a>

But that's literally all I could find. I'm guessing that she's fairly religious, but doesn't feel the need to bring it into every conversation or interview. Sounds like a good Irish Catholic to me.


## The Politics of the Not Impressed

Maroney, as of the writing of the article, isn't old enough to vote, and it doesn't look like she's formed a great deal of opinions about politics yet. There are Democrats in her family though, for what it's worth. She talked up her cousin James Maroney on her Twitter account,<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/McKaylaMaroney/status/266006905988722689" title="McKaylaMaroney: &quot;@MMaroneyFans: #Confirmed …">[4]</a> who won a Congressional seat for the Democrats in 2012. (([UPDATE: Maroney Defeats Staneski in Close Race.](http://milford.patch.com/articles/maroney-staneski-face-off-in-119th-district) Milford Patch.))

She also met with President Obama and the two of them made Maroney's "[Not Impressed](http://news.yahoo.com/year-in-review-2012-most-viral-photos-mckayla-maroney-005945704.html;_ylt=As6G0CibeEZsyO5Y4kkYTE5DU19H;_ylu=X3oDMTRwZzMxbHY4BG1pdAMyMDEyIFlJUiBWaXJhbCBQaG90byBDYXJvdXNlbARwa2cDMzc3NGNhMTYtZWI5Ny0zYWI3LWI0NzYtNWE3OTEzYzRiOGVlBHBvcwMxBHNlYwNNZWRpYUJDYXJvdXNlbE1peGVkTFBDQVRlbXAEdmVyAzFiMDM5MjMzLTNmM2QtMTFlMi1iZmRhLWFiOTk4Y2UyYTI0NQ--;_ylg=X3oDMTJqNDg5amVyBGludGwDdXMEbGFuZwNlbi11cwRwc3RhaWQDOGUxODdlNjEtYTlmYi0zYzFiLTllMTQtYWMxMTQzNTliMTk1BHBzdGNhdAMEcHQDc3RvcnlwYWdl;_ylv=3)" face together ([check out the picture](http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57551503/mckayla-maroney-obama-not-impressed-photo-spreads-fast/))–the one she famously made on the Olympic podium after winning silver for the vault in 2012. The gymnast said about the meeting,

>It was really kind of like mindblowing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://video.today.msnbc.msn.com/today/49884403#49884403" title="TODAY: McKayla: Obama asked to do &apos;unimpressed&apos; face.">[5]</a>

Maybe that's a 16-year-old's version of a presidential endorsement. But we'll probably have a little more to go on as she gets older. Keep us updated in the comments!
