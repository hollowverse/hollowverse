Hilary Swank was born in Bellingham, Washington. She grew up there and in Los Angeles, California.

Swank considers herself a spiritual, but has never been an adherent of any particular organized religion. While talking about a movie in which she played a former theologian who lost her faith, she said,

>Well, I believe in a higher power. I was not baptized, or into organized religion, and all of that, but it's definitely interesting.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wildaboutmovies.com%2Finterviews%2FHilary-Swank-InterviewReapingMovie.php" title="Hilary-Swank-Interview, Reaping Movie.">[1]</a>

Swank mentioned that she respects both the scientific and religious communities' explanations for the world's mysteries, but she stopped short of saying that she believes in miracles. She said,

>I've seen in my own life, just a lot of things that have happened that have been, I wouldn't say miraculous, but I would just say a blessing. And I think maybe I have a lot of luck. I had to work really hard, but there's a lot of luck. But I haven't, myself, witnessed a miracle.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wildaboutmovies.com%2Finterviews%2FHilary-Swank-InterviewReapingMovie.php" title="Hilary-Swank-Interview, Reaping Movie.">[2]</a>

It almost sounds like she's a little bit agnostic towards some aspects of religion, but I can't put words in her mouth. So we'll just put her in the spiritual, not religious category for now.


## Shame on Swank

Swank prefers not to let her political persuasions be known. When asked who she was voting for in the 2008 election, she said,

>I don't usually talk about my politics as a general rule.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.time.com%2Ftime%2Farts%2Farticle%2F0%2C8599%2C1604012%2C00.html" title="More Questions for Hilary Swank.">[3]</a>

Despite her general rule, she did express her support for gay marriage. After Vice President Joe Biden put his political weight behind the issue, she said,

>I feel like it's phenomenal. I think it's a big positive step forward and one we should have been way past.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tvguide.com%2FNews%2FVIDEO-Debra-Messing-1047334.aspx" title="Debra Messing, Glenn Close, Hilary Swank React to Marriage Equality News.">[4]</a>

So she's probably liberal, but my guess is that she's not all that political, because if she was, she might not have gotten herself into a mess with Ramzan Kadyrov, the Chechen head of state who has been accused of human rights violations. Swank was paid to attend the leader's birthday party in 2011 with a few other celebrities, apparently unaware of the controversy surrounding him. After the Human Rights Foundation raised questions about her appearance, she publicly apologized saying,

>Shame on me. The bottom line is I should know where I'm going and I should do better research.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpopwatch.ew.com%2F2011%2F12%2F03%2Fhilary-swank-chechnya-apology-tonight-show%2F" title="Hilary Swank apologizes for Chechnya appearance on &apos;The Tonight Show.&apos;">[5]</a>

Her lack of knowledge about Chechnya's political situation isn't unusual for an American, but the fact that she traveled to the other side of the world for a birthday party for a man she didn't bother to Google might indicate that she's not too tapped into global politics.
