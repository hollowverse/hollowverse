Iker Casillas Fernández was born in Móstoles, Spain, just outside Madrid. He was raised there and also briefly in the Basque Country.

Casillas' religion is a matter of much internet speculation, which teeters between Muslim and Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20100711154653AAA1heV" title="Is Iker Casillas a Muslim?">[1]</a> It seems more likely to me that he is Catholic, and not only because around 70% of Spaniards are devoted to that religion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_Spain" title="Religion in Spain.">[2]</a>

Casillas' parents are from Spain, and most of Spain's Muslim population are fairly recent immigrants.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islam_in_Spain" title="Islam in Spain.">[3]</a> He has also earned the nickname "Saint Iker" for his divine goalkeeping abilities,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/Euro/2012/06/28/19930351.html" title="&apos;Saint&apos; Iker tops list of Spanish heroes.">[4]</a> which says more about the religion of his country than of himself, although I couldn't find any indication that he minds the title.

It's also entirely possible that Casillas is simply not religious at all. Or. . . he's established his own church under the guise of a [fan blog](http://thechurchofsaniker.tumblr.com/page/22). It's all speculation from here, folks. Leave us a comment if you can steer us toward some facts.

Casillas has equally little say about politics, aside from his hope that football can be a positive distraction from the bad economic news which relentlessly plagues his country.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/Euro/2012/06/28/19930351.html" title="&apos;Saint&apos; Iker tops list of Spanish heroes.">[5]</a>

Although he doesn't appear to have anything to say about Catalan independence, at least one blogger thought that a Casillas transfer from Real Madrid to Barça could do more than politicians to quell the independence movement and restore civility between the two camps.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jimmy-burns.com/blog/politics/valdes-iker-casillas-politics-spain/" title="Valdes, Iker Casillas, &amp; the politics of Spain.">[6]</a>

My guess is that Casillas would rather not be a pawn for either side in the middle of that debate.
