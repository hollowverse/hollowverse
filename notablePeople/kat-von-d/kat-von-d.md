Kat Von D, real name Katherine von Drachenberg, was born in Montemorelos, Mexico and raised in Colton, California.

Von D was raised in a strictly religious Seventh Day Adventist Christian home.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.military.com/entertainment/books/book-news/new-canvas-for-kat-von-d" title="A New Canvas for Kat Von D">[1]</a> In fact, when Kat was born, her parents–both Argentinian–were traveling missionaries for the church.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/11/women.leoniecooper" title="Leonie Cooper on the new female-friendly tattoo industry">[2]</a>

One gets the sense that Von D isn't too religious anymore. She has spoken frequently on the break she made from her family when entering her chosen career as a tattoo artist and the difficulties it caused:

>Like, I was brought up Seventh Day Adventist, which is Christian. My parents had a hard time with me being tattooed. They were like you're desecrating your body. I think it took them at least ten years for them to realize that it was a positive thing.<a class="source-citation" href="http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1010/27/joy.01.html" title="Transcripts">[3]</a>

Things are alright now between Von D and her parents,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.military.com/entertainment/books/book-news/new-canvas-for-kat-von-d" title="A New Canvas for Kat Von D">[4]</a> but with boyfriends like ex-Motley Crue singer Nikki Sixx<a class="source-citation" href="http://blog.zap2it.com/pop2it/2011/07/kat-von-d-from-jesse-james-to-nikki-sixx-a-relationship-timeline.html" title="Kat Von D: From Jesse James to Nikki Sixx, a relationship timeline">[5]</a> and suspected Nazi Jessie James,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/26/jesse-james-linked-to-mor_n_814207.html" title="Jesse James Linked To More Nazi Photos, Called Names By Ex-Employees">[6]</a> it seems reasonable to assume she's not a good little Christian girl anymore.


## Counter-culture politics

Kat Von D isn't political in the traditional sense. No candidate endorsements or campaign contributions, but she has become a bit of an icon for both tattooed women and women in the tattoo business.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/11/women.leoniecooper" title="Leonie Cooper on the new female-friendly tattoo industry">[7]</a>

And she's an immigrant of purebred Argentinian descent. Her family moved to the U.S. when she was four-years-old.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.monstersandcritics.com/people/Kat-Von-D/biography/" title="Kat Von D Biography">[8]</a> So you can imagine her being sympathetic to the many immigrants–both legal and illegal–in the immigration battleground of Southern California where she now resides.

Von D is also sympathetic to the gay community, attending charity events for gay rights<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebitchy.com/151438/kat_von_d_jesse_james_attend_an_event_for_lesbians/" title="Kat Von D attends an event for lesbians, brings Jessie James">[9]</a> and speaking out on their behalf. She said:

>I'm really supportive [of the gay community], and in California, where we work, it's been a tough time because of Proposition 8. Look, I know what it's like to be treated differently…and, for me, I chose my lifestyle. Oh, and I love drag queens. They're great with make-up tips.<a class="source-citation" href="http://newyork.metromix.com/events/article/q-and-a-kat/1021801/content" title="Q&amp;A: Kat Von D">[10]</a>

So what we've got here is a liberal champion of marginalized American subcultures–pretty cool really.
