Ellen Degeneres grew up in Metairie, Louisiana. She has French, English, German, and Irish roots.

Ellen was raised a Christian Scientist, a sect of Christianity that doesn't believe people should see doctors or take medication. She has since come out as (classic celebrity) spiritual but not religious.

Only speculation here, but I bet she didn't want to die of strep throat–or maybe she had a headache and took an aspirin.

She has said:

>I was raised very, very strictly with Christian Science. I didn't have a shot or an aspirin or anything until I was 13 years old. We had to go to church, do testimonies every Wednesday night. I think all religion is based on what happens after this life. You live a certain way so that when you die, things can be good. But why can't things be good now? Why can't you understand that you're in heaven now? That's how I live. I believe in God. I think that God is everywhere. Every morning I look outside, and I say, 'Hi, God.' Because I think that the trees are God. I think that our whole experience is God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpd%2FEllen_DeGeneres.html" title="The Religious Affiliation of Actress/Comedian Ellen Degeneres">[1]</a>

Our whole experience is God? What is with celebrities and pantheism?<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPantheism" title="Pantheism">[2]</a>

Continuing about her beliefs, Ellen said:

>I was raised Christian Science, which is like 'mind over matter.' I think there is something to that. But I have a problem with a lot of the rules. I don't believe the god that I believe in is judgmental. I think whatever works for you is right. Heaven or hell is what you create right this minute where you are. You have a choice to live in joy or not. And that's my belief. If I'm wrong, then I'm wrong, but I'm not hurting anybody.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpd%2FEllen_DeGeneres.html" title="The Religious Affiliation of Actress/Comedian Ellen Degeneres">[3]</a>

## It's all about being gay

When it comes to politics, Ellen is about as undecided as she is about religion. She has said:

>I'm not a political person, and that may be surprising to hear. I don't know enough about what's going on to say anything. It's probably fair to say that I'd support the Democratic candidate, but that being said, I really don't know who it will be.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.time.com%2Ftime%2Fmagazine%2Farticle%2F0%2C9171%2C993428-1%2C00.html" title="10 Questions for Ellen Degeneres">[4]</a>

But wait, when it comes to gay marriage, Ellen is suddenly political. She has said:

>So, in case I haven't made myself clear, I'm FOR gay marriage. And in order to protect that right — please VOTE NO on Proposition 8. And now that you're informed, spread the word. I'm begging you. I can't return the wedding gifts — I love my new toaster.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fellen.warnerbros.com%2F2008%2F09%2Fmy_political_point_and_i_do_ha.php" title="My Political Point…And I Do Have One">[5]</a>

During the 2008 presidential campaign, Ellen had Republican John McCain on her talk show and she grilled him a little about gay marriage–which McCain has strongly opposed. Ellen said:

>It's looked at [like] blacks and women didn't have the right to vote. Women just got the right to vote in 1920, blacks didn't have the right to vote until 1870 and it just feels like there's this old way of thinking that we are not all the same.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dt7NZoN-LXxI" title="John McCain Faces Off with Ellen Degeneres">[6]</a>

Why don't you just say it, Ellen? You conservatives are back in the stone age and it's time to get with the program.
