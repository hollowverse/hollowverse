Shyla Stylez, whose real name is Amanda Friedland was born and raised in Armstrong, British Columbia, Canada.

Her religion is listed as "Christian – other" on her MySpace page<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.myspace.com/328372512" title="Shyla Stylez.">[1]</a> but it seems like the closest thing Stylez has had to a religious experience is appearing alongside fellow porn actor Jez Christ in the movie Let Me Kiss It To Make It Better.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.data18.com/share/jez-christ_shyla-stylez.html" title="Jez Christ and Shyla Stylez.">[2]</a> Or maybe it was Jez that had the religious experience.

We can make an educated guess that the "other" next to Christian means probably not that Christian at all. I can't see her showing up at church every Sunday fresh from a shoot and sitting next to Grandma, but porn stars have been known to surprise in the past. Until she lets us know otherwise though, I think we can classify her as non-religious.

Politics isn't really her thing either, unless you count having an affair with the assistant sheriff a political statement.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-05-26/features/internal-affairs/" title="Internal Affairs.">[3]</a> But, in line with her political beliefs (or lack thereof), all she had to say about what eventually became a sex scandal in the Orange County Sherrif's department was:

>I'm not going to confirm anything about anything. You've caught me off-guard.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ocweekly.com/2005-05-26/features/internal-affairs/2/" title="Internal Affairs.">[4]</a>

We could guess that Stylez is a Republican, considering she may want to hang onto every last penny of her $1 million fortune.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.getnetworth.com/shyla-stylez-net-worth/" title="Shyla Stylez Net Worth.">[5]</a> But assuming that she cares enough about politics to associate with a particular party might be assuming too much.
