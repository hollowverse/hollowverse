Bella Thorne was born in Pembroke Pines, Florida. She grew up there and in Los Angeles, California.

This young actress is definitely a deeply devoted Christian, but I couldn't pin down which denomination. She's a frequent church-goer, and apparently has her own set of beliefs. We just don't know exactly what those are:

>I go to church almost every Sunday. My beliefs may not be the same as other people in my church or even in my family.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.examiner.com/article/exclusive-interview-disney-star-bella-thorne-talks-about-being-the-new-teenie-on-big-love" title="Exclusive Interview: Disney star Bella Thorne talks about being the new Teenie on Big Love.">[1]</a>

Twitter is like an open religious forum for Thorne. She'll tweet pictures of herself at church,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://disneyinfonet.com/bella-goes-to-church-and-garret-snowboards-bellathorne-gbackstrom/" title="Bella Goes To Church and Garret Snowboards.">[2]</a> tell her fans that the Bible was the book that changed her life,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://fanity.com/BellaThorne/lyrics/1347650919" title="Bella Thorne Lyrics.">[3]</a> and she fairly frequently tweets religious phrases like this one:

>"God places the heaviest burden on those who can carry its weight."<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/bellathorne/status/85340131732631552" title="bellathorne: &quot;God places the heaviest …">[4]</a>

So she's making it pretty clear that religion is a huge part of her life, even if she hasn't shared yet exactly what the details of her faith entail.


## A Liberal in the Making

Thorne is a little young to have a very well-developed set of political beliefs, but all signs point to liberal. She tweeted a congratulations to Barack Obama after winning his second term as president in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dis411.net/2012/11/07/bella-thorne-congratulates-president-obama-for-winning-the-election-november-6-2012/" title="Bella Thorne Congratulates President Obama For Winning The Election November 6, 2012.">[5]</a>

It's possible that as she gets older she'll get into the animal rights movement since she's a self-proclaimed animal lover. And she mentioned PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) in a tweet about evacuating animals during Hurricane Sandy in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tweetwood.com/bellathorne/mentions/peta" title="Bella Thorne mentioning peta on twitter.">[6]</a>

She is also involved with the anti-bullying organization Stomp Out Bullying. She has personal experience with the issue since she was bullied as a kid for being dyslexic. She said about her experiences as a global ambassador for the organization,

>I've been to lots of schools and I've talked to [kids] about bullying and it's so sad every time I go there. There are always so many kids that talk about how they've been bullied so much in their school, and that breaks my heart.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/11/shake-it-up-star-bella-thorne-bullying_n_1653071.html" title="&apos;Shake It Up&apos; Star Bella Thorne On Teen Bullying: &apos;I Know How Much It Sucks.&apos;">[7]</a>

It sounds like we could have the makings of a bleeding-heart liberal Hollywood star on our hands, but as she gets a little older, we'll just have to wait and see.
