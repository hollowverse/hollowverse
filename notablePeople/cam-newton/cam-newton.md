Cam Newton was born in Savannah, Georgia and grew up in College Park, Georgia.

Newton is highly religious, though it's unclear what religion that might be. We do know it is monotheistic, so that narrows it down to Judaism, Islam and Christianity. He said in a moment of college football glory, crediting God to his success:

>It's just a God thing. I thank God every single day. I'm just His instrument and He's using me on a consistent basis daily. [God is] using me to extend His word and I'm a prime example of how God could turn something that was bad into something that was very great… If God is with me who can be against me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.blackchristiannews.com/news/2012/01/cam-newton-its-just-a-god-thing.html" title="Cam Newton: &quot;It&apos;s Just a God Thing.&quot;">[1]</a>

But let's be honest, he's a Georgia boy, hailing from the suburbs of the Bible belt, and black. It seems safe to assume he's Christian, and with a bit of conjecture, Baptist seems likely. But as a little disclaimer, no evidence I can find supports that claim. If you've got any proof–or contradictory information–please let us know in the comments.


## Politics of failed superstition

Newton seems relatively unconcerned with politics. When his college team won the national championships, Obama invited them to the White House for some congratulatory handshakes,<a class="source-citation" href="http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2011/06/obama-hails-the-auburn-tigers-and-gibbs/1#.ULz-hIUZ-Bg" title="Obama hails the Auburn Tigers (and Gibbs)">[2]</a> which was probably very nice.

But did he vote for Obama? We don't know. But as a black man, Newton has made it very clear he's not going to get wrapped up in anything racial, so throwing a vote to Obama because he's black seems out of the question. Asked about the difference between white and black quarterbacks, Newton emphatically responded:

>Sir, it all comes down to whether a person wins or loses. I don't bring race into the game, because then you're talking about excuses. I. Hate. Excuses. Excuses are a disease.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.gq.com/style/wear-it-now/201107/cam-newton-gq-july-2011-interview" title="Cam Newton GQ Interview">[3]</a>

There was some speculation that Newton had sealed Romney's victory in the 2012 election. According to an old superstition dating back to the 1940s, every election year, if the Washington Redskins won their last home game in D.C. before election day, it meant that the incumbent president would remain in office.

Well, Newton's Carolina Panthers soundly defeated the Redskins at their last home game in D.C. before the 2012 elections. Republicans rejoiced and Democrats lamented–but for the first time ever, the superstition did not hold true.<a class="source-citation" href="http://politicalinsider.blogs.mydesert.com/2012/11/05/did-cam-newton-just-seal-barack-obamas-political-fortunes-tuesday/" title="Did Cam Newton just seal Barack Obama&apos;s political fortunes Tuesday?">[4]</a>

Thus far, that is the extent of Newton's political involvement.
