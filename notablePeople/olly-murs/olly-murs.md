Olly Murs was born and raised in Witham, Essex, England.

Murs does not appear to be a religious man. One fellow with bad grammar insists that he's Baptist,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_religion_is_Olly_Murs" title="What religion is Olly Murs.">[1]</a> but that's about as far as that goes.

He celebrates Christmas,<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/ollyofficial/status/283362016385695744" title="ollyofficial: MERRY CHRISTMAS EVERYONEEEEEEEE!!">[2]</a> so that suggests at least a vaguely Christian background. And that would make sense, him being an Englishman and all.

He mentions prayer in passing in one song, but not in a particularly religious way.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.metrolyrics.com/ask-me-to-stay-lyrics-olly-murs.html" title="Olly Murs – Ask Me To Stay Lyrics.">[3]</a> And then he mentions karma in another song,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/ollymurs/changeisgonnacome.html" title="Olly Murs Lyrics – Change Is Gonna Come.">[4]</a> but you don't get the impression that it's because he's really into Hinduism.

So, at the end of the day, we'll have to call him non-religious–until further notice.


## Political Bobbleheads

I couldn't find anything to indicate that Murs is interested in the politics of his own country, but he seems to be paying at least a little bit of attention to the U.S. After Barack Obama won reelection in 2012, Murs tweeted,

>Well done OBAMA!! Just realised I need to get him as a bobblehead! Don't have him in my collection!! #gottabedone<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tweetwood.com/ollyofficial/tweet/266111641849049088" title="Olly Murs tweets.">[5]</a>

It's tough to say if that translates into support of the Labour party in the U.K. or not. Maybe next time an election comes around, we'll see something from him on his Twitter feed.

Aside from his one candidate endorsement, Murs doesn't have anything to say about politics. Nothing about the big political issues of the day. However, even though he didn't throw his explicit support behind gay marriage, he does seem to be down with gay people,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/4312302/Olly-Murs-gets-lippy-in-Oz-chat.html" title="Olly Murs gets lippy in Australian chat.">[6]</a> so one could assume he'd be down with them getting married too.

But that's all we've got on Murs. If you can help us out with any more reliable information, please let us know in the comments!
