Rita Ora was born in Pristina, Yugoslavia (now Kosovo). She was raised in London, England.

There's a rumor going around that Ora is Muslim<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/CelebFactstory/status/229426085803220993" title="CelebFactstory: Muslim celebrities: Akon, Rita …">[1]</a> because she was born in a country with a large Muslim population.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.crisisgroup.org/en/regions/europe/balkans/kosovo/105-religion-in-kosovo.aspx" title="Religion in Kosovo.">[2]</a> But it's just not true. She's some kind of Christian, and most likely Catholic.

She went to a Catholic school growing up,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.aceshowbiz.com/celebrity/rita_ora/biography.html" title="Rita Ora Biography and Life Story.">[3]</a> and it appears that she takes praying seriously. In one [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Yhvjpl_5DvM#!), there's a little snippet of her with a group of people in a circle while one of them is saying a prayer. It's hard to hear what exactly the guy is saying, something about "Father God. . ." Ora hears someone whispering in the group and calls him out:

>Hold on, sorry. I'm taking this serious. . . . This is a serious moment. I heard you whispering and I'm getting in my zone.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=Yhvjpl_5DvM#!" title="RITA ORA – UK Tour Diary Part 2.">[4]</a>

It's not much to go on, but it rules out Muslim, makes her sound Catholic, and indicates that she's at least moderately religious.


## Kosovar Patriot

Ora feels deeply patriotic to Kosovo, her parents' home before they were forced out by the Kosovo War, and the place where she was born.

>It was hard growing up when I was younger because I moved from Kosovo and I wish I was around my people. I think us as a nation, Kosovo as a nation, we're proud of where we're from because it's such a small place so anyone that succeeds from there, it's just a big deal. So I'm doing it for my family and for my country as much as I'm doing it for anyone else.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0Cod2i86BI" title="Albanian singer Rita Ora singing and talking about Kosova.">[5]</a>

And people in Kosovo seem to love her just as much as she loves them. She was invited by the president of the nation to perform at a celebration of Albanian independence.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/what-s-on/rita_ora_heading_to_kosovo_to_play_political_rally_1_1494609" title="Rita Ora heading to Kosovo to play political rally.">[6]</a>

Despite her status as an immigrant, Ora doesn't seem to have anything to say about British immigration policy–or anything having to do with British politics for that matter.
