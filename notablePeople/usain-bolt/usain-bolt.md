Usain St. Leo Bolt was born and raised in Sherwood Content, Trelawny, Jamaica.

Bolt is a Catholic and his middle name was given to him in honor of one of the Catholic Church's earliest Popes.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholicnewsagency.com%2Fnews%2Fvatican-invites-usain-bolt-to-address-religious-liberty-conference%2F" title="Vatican Invites Usain Bolt to address religious liberty conference">[1]</a> Bolt is devout in his faith. He makes the sign of the cross before beginning a competition and, according to his public relations people, he is a "Bible-believing, God-honoring, Jesus-worshiping Christian."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianstogether.net%2FArticles%2F322891%2FChristians_Together_in%2FChristian_Life%2FCurrent_News%2FWhy_does_the.aspx" title="Why does the BBC ignore Usain Bolt&apos;s God?">[2]</a>

It's not something he talks much about. Though he does occasionally tweet things like:

>With God anything is possible… I demolish training today #thankuGod<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fusainbolt" title="Usain St. Leo Bolt (usainbolt) on Twitter">[3]</a>

His faith and his celebrity inspired the Vatican to invite him to speak at a conference on global religious liberty through the popular TED (technology, entertainment and design) program.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholicnewsagency.com%2Fnews%2Fvatican-invites-usain-bolt-to-address-religious-liberty-conference%2F" title="Vatican Invites Usain Bolt to address religious liberty conference">[4]</a> I imagine that's a high honor for any Catholic.

An interesting side-note–and we run across this surprisingly often at the Hollowverse–some Protestants have claimed Bolt as one of their own.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianstogether.net%2FArticles%2F322891%2FChristians_Together_in%2FChristian_Life%2FCurrent_News%2FWhy_does_the.aspx" title="Why does the BBC ignore Usain Bolt&apos;s God?">[5]</a> They simply assert that he is a Protestant with no evidence, presumably because they like him… I don't know. Don't believe them, he's a Catholic.


## The natural political environment of the wealthy

Bolt's politics can only be gleaned from sparse comments here and there. Sometimes, these comments only serve to stroke Bolt's ego, such as:

>If Queen Elizabeth knighthooded me and I would get the title Sir Usain Bolt. That sounds very nice.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brainyquote.com%2Fquotes%2Fauthors%2Fu%2Fusain_bolt.html" title="Usain Bolt Quotes">[6]</a>

Sometimes, they are general statements about his love for his home country of Jamaica:

>I can't really live outside Jamaica. I can be away, but only for a while.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.brainyquote.com%2Fquotes%2Fauthors%2Fu%2Fusain_bolt.html" title="Usain Bolt Quotes">[7]</a>

Once, when asked why he didn't travel more often to England, he complained about the high taxes that country places upon the wealthy for things like speaking engagement fees and endorsement/sponsorship earnings. He later said when the tax laws change, he'd be more than happy to go to the UK.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newstatesman.com%2Fblogs%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F08%2Fusain-bolt-wrong-oppose-our-tax-laws" title="Usain Bolt is wrong to oppose our tax laws">[8]</a>

Other than that, there's not much from Bolt politically. He was referenced by U.S. President Obama during the 2012 election cycle. Obama said:

>I just want to remind you this is not going to be a race like Usain Bolt where we're like 40 yards ahead and we can just start jogging 10 feet before the finish line.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2Fblogs%2Fpolitics%2F2012%2F08%2Fobama-im-not-a-usain-bolt%2F" title="Obama: I&apos;m No Usain Bolt">[9]</a>

It would be telling if Bolt had said he was flattered by the reference, but as far as I can tell, not a peep.
