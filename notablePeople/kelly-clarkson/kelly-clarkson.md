Kelly Clarkson was born and raised in Fort Worth, Texas.

Clarkson was raised a strict Southern Baptist. She explains her religious upbringing:

>I come from a conservative family. My family was highly conservative; I had to go to church on Sunday and Wednesday.<a class="source-citation" href="http://music-mix.ew.com/2011/08/31/kelly-clarkson-on-the-soundtrack-of-her-life-read-her-exclusive-ew-interview-here/" title="Kelly Clarkson on the soundtrack of her life">[1]</a>

And while acknowledging the importance of religion during her childhood, Clarkson confirmed in 2004 that it's become even more important to her in adulthood:

>I always grew up in church. I was the leader of our youth group. I've always grown up pretty close to church and with God. But I think I've just gotten a lot closer just because He's the only One I can lean on.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.crosswalk.com/culture/music/listening-in-with-rj-helton-and-kelly-clarkson-1263775.html" title="Listening In.. With R.J. Helton and Kelly Clarkson">[2]</a>

It would seem that Christianity is a big deal for Clarkson, though she insists that she's not a "fundamentalist."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.beliefnet.com/Celebrity-Faith-Database/C/Kelly-Clarkson.aspx" title="Celebrity Faith: Kelly Clarkson">[3]</a>

## A Mixed Bag

Politically, Clarkson is a bit all over the place, indicating an independent or moderate stance on politics.

For example, she married a Republican who declared his support for Mitt Romney in 2012, but in both 2008 and 2012, she voted for Obama, even declaring herself an "Obama girl."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.mtv.com/news/1696892/kelly-clarkson-presidential-election-barack-obama/" title="Kelly Clarkson an &apos;Obama Girl&apos;–Even If Her Man Backs Romney">[4]</a>

One wonders about the political discussions in the Clarkson household, as she once explained why she couldn't support Mitt Romney:

>I can't support Romney's policies as I have a lot of gay friends and I don't think it's fair they can't get married.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.advocate.com/politics/election/2012/10/22/kelly-clarkson-likely-vote-obama-because-gay-issues" title="Kelly Clarkson Likely To Vote Obama Because of Gay Issues">[5]</a>

Interestingly, the previous year, as Republican primaries were underway, Clarkson expressed support for Republican (though formerly Libertarian) candidate, Ron Paul, saying:

>I love Ron Paul. I liked him a lot during the last Republican nomination and no one gave him a chance. If he wins the nomination for the Republican party in 2012 he's got my vote.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kelly-clarkson-endorses-ron-paul-20112912" title="Kelly Clarkson Endorses Ron Paul">[6]</a>

And when asked about her views on the death penalty, she seemed to qualify her statement from the frame of being a Republican, in a sort of 'this is how I'm different from my fellow Republicans' way. She said:

>I don't believe in the death penalty. Most Republicans do but not me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.thewrap.com/tv/article/kelly-clarkson-endorses-ron-paul-33968/" title="Kelly Clarkson Endorses Ron Paul">[7]</a>

Clarkson appears to be a person who evaluates issues rather than parties–and that's great.
