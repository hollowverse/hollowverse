Dylan Sprouse was born in Arezzo, Italy and grew up in Long Beach, California.

There's not much at all out there about Sprouse's religion, except lots of speculation on fan sites that him and his twin brother Cole are Christians.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.fanpix.net/gallery/dylan-sprouse-pictures.htm" title="Dylan Sprouse Pictures.">[1]</a>

Dylan did allude to the fact that it may be true when he and his brother appeared on the Ellen DeGeneres Show back in 2007. After she asked them if they had girlfriends, Dylan responded,

>I'm actually looking for a Christian girl with morals and values.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aEK3ztQinMs" title="Cole and Dylan Sprouse on Ellen DeGeneres on October 2nd 2007.">[2]</a>

But apparently it was a joke because everyone started laughing really hard. So, maybe it's safe to assume that he's not super-religious. We'll have to go with non-religious until further notice.

Likewise, Dylan appears to be completely non-political. There's no mention of politics–including the 2012 presidential election which was the first time he was old enough to vote–on his Twitter feed.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/sprousearts" title="Dylan Sprouse (sprousearts) on Twitter.">[3]</a> And there didn't appear to be anything on his Tumblr blog either.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://bausprouse.tumblr.com/" title="BauSprouse.">[4]</a>

He's a student of fine arts at New York University,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0819851/bio" title="Dylan Sprouse – Biography.">[5]</a> and he is a former Hollywood actor. If we were to go by stereotypes, I would say that makes him sound pretty liberal.

On the website he created to showcase his art, Sprouse makes it clear that he's not interested in talking about his personal life,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.sprousearts.com/?page_id=4" title="About.">[6]</a> so it doesn't look like we're going to get any concrete answers soon. If you have any inside information about Dylan, let us know in the comments!
