Sarah Michelle Gellar was born and raised in Manhattan, New York.

Gellar is Jewish. Her mother and late father are Jewish, and word is, her mother is quite religious.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jweekly.com/article/full/30619/celebrity-jews/" title="Celebrity Jews">[1]</a> In fact, take out her middle name and "Sarah Gellar" is a pretty Jewish name. The Jew celebrity devoutness-rating website, [Jew or Not Jew](http://www.jewornotjew.com/profile.jsp?ID=157), gave Gellar a "Jew" score of 10 out of 15 because of the whole middle name deception. But that might not be the only reason.

Gellar has openly expressed her disregard for organized religion, saying:

>I don't believe in organized religion and I never have.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/bio" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar – Biography">[2]</a>

Furthermore, despite her mother's alleged religiosity, Gellar admitted to having Christmas trees growing up–but only because it was "pretty."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.marksfriggin.com/news99/3-1-99.htm" title="Stern Show News">[3]</a>

I might go out on a limb and say "Jew or Not Jew's" rating was a bit high.


## Political dualism

Gellar's political affiliations are suspect. There are sources upon sources claiming that she is a registered Republican.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.wetpaint.com/network/gallery/surprising-celebrities-who-are-republican/photo/surprising-republicans-sarah-michelle-gellar" title="Who Knew These Celebrities Were Republican?">[4]</a> One or two websites and I'd think it was a rumor, but given the sheer amount of people and organizations calling her a Republican, I'd have to say there's something behind it.

However, the words out of Gellar's mouth point straight to liberal Democrat. For example, when asked about her thoughts on the 2008 election, (Obama's victory) she said:

>I'm thrilled, I couldn't ask for anything better.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU3NKpTJOCU" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar thrilled over Obama win">[5]</a>

And her thoughts on gay marriage are a far-cry from the standard Republican Party ideology. She said:

>I have good friends, gay couples, who've been together for 18 years. It drives me crazy that in the eyes of the law, their love isn't acknowledged when I have girlfriends who have married four times by the age of 25.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001264/bio" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar – Biography">[6]</a>

And she was not "thrilled" about 2008's passage of the California anti-gay marriage law, Prop 8. She said:

>I think it's criminal, it's shameful.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rU3NKpTJOCU" title="Sarah Michelle Gellar thrilled over Obama win">[7]</a>

So, The Hollowverse will fly in the face of the numerous sites claiming Gellar is a Republican and declare her a liberal Democrat. Feel free to dispute in the comments.
