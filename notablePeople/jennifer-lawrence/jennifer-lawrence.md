Jennifer Lawrence was born and raised in Louisville, Kentucky.

She has not spoken about her religious views or the views of her family. Her fan sites speculate that she is Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_religion_is_Jennifer_Lawrence" title="What religion is Jennifer Lawrence">[1]</a> which seems reasonable considering she's a white American girl. But I would submit that she's probably not very religious or devout if she is.

Based on conjecture, my best guess for Lawrence is Catholic. Louisville, Kentucky is a very religious town, with 1 of 3 residents being Southern Baptist, the largest denomination in that city. But the second largest religion is Catholic, with 1 in 6 Louisville residents claiming that faith.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville,_Kentucky#Religion" title="Louisville, Kentucky">[2]</a> Given that a large proportion of Louisville's population is black, which probably accounts for much, if not most, of the Southern Baptists, I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Lawrence is Catholic.


## Strange politics

Lawrence hasn't taken a political stand either, but she's fun to watch and an interesting and unorthodox person in interviews.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5Pr29nu-54" title="Chelsea Lately interview of Jennifer Lawrence">[3]</a> Given her talkativeness and candor, something controversial will slip eventually.

She did make one statement that put her at odds with liberals, and might even officially put her in the conservative camp:

>I should say it wasn't real, for PETA, but screw PETA.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.evilbeetgossip.com/2012/04/11/quotables-jennifer-lawrence-says-screw-peta/" title="Quotables: Jennifer Lawrence Says &quot;Screw PETA.&quot;">[4]</a>

Yes, that's PETA, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Lawrence was referring to a scene in one of her films where she killed and gutted a squirrel. Apparently, it was real.

I'm looking forward to more slip-ups from Lawrence, myself.
