Chloë Grace Moretz was born in Atlanta, Georgia and grew up there and in Cartersville, Georgia and in New York City.

Moretz has described her family as "very Christian"<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.austin360.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/austinmovies/entries/2010/03/13/_we_had_a_quick.html/" title="SXSW: Live with that &apos;Kick-Ass&apos; girl, Chloe Moretz">[1]</a> and she adheres to (or is forced to) adhere to her faith.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.examiner.com/article/chloe-grace-moretz" title="Chloe Grace Moretz – National Celebrity Profile">[2]</a> Moretz has repeatedly spoken of how strict her mother is regarding conventions of morality–particularly using profane language. Moretz' character in the film, Kick Ass, was a rather foul-mouthed youngster and Moretz commented:

>If I ever uttered one word that I said in "Kick-Ass," I would be grounded for years! I'd be stuck in my room until I was 20! I would never in a million years say that. I'm an average, everyday girl… I have to go to bed at 9:30, and, if I'm up late on the computer, I lose it for two months.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1631269/bio" title="Chloë Grace Moretz – Biography">[3]</a>

But Moretz hasn't disclosed any of her theological or cosmological beliefs, though at such a young age, it might not be necessary to philosophically justify one's beliefs–only to be an obedient, good girl. And Moretz seems like a perfectly good girl–for the time being. Watch her discuss being disciplined in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOO-Z889KKE) clip with Jimmy Kimmel.


## Politics? Nope

Well, Moretz isn't the slightest bit political yet. One would imagine that her political beliefs at the moment would be whatever her mother's political beliefs are. Not saying it's a bad thing. Read about Moretz' peer in the entertainment industry, Taylor Momsen, and marvel at the difference.

Though, as is often the case with children who have highly religious disciplinarians for parents, there might be in Moretz' future a very public break from her family's values. We'll see.

Moretz has lent her star power to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) for a Trick-or-Treat for charity event, urging kids and parents to donate to less fortunate children in the third world over Halloween.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2012/10/16/chloe_moretz_to_front_unicef_trickortr" title="Chloe Moretz to Front UNICEF Trick-Or-Treat Campaign">[4]</a>

By the time the 2016 elections roll around, Moretz will be barely able to vote. Maybe then we can expect some sort of statement from her. Keep us updated in the comments.
