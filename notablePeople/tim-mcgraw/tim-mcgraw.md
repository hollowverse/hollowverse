Tim McGraw was born in Delhi, Louisiana and grew up in Start, Louisiana.

McGraw grew up a Baptist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.icelebz.com/quotes/tim_mcgraw/" title="Tim McGraw quotes, quotations, phrases, words">[1]</a> He's no evangelist, though, that's for sure. He does sing about faith (not his wife) on occasion, but in a somewhat questioning manner. For example, in his song, "Drugs or Jesus," McGraw implies that in his hometown, you're getting high on either drugs or Jesus. He sings:

>My whole life/I've tried to run, I've tried to hide/From the stained glass windows in my mind/Refusing to let God's light shine/Down on me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azlyrics.com/lyrics/timmcgraw/drugsorjesus.html" title="Tim McGraw Lyrics – Drugs or Jesus">[2]</a>

The line would imply that McGraw regrets some of the decisions in his life, decisions that might have been different had religion been involved. By the end, he's singing "Hallelujah" at the top of his lungs, complete with sappy string arrangements.

Beyond that, songs like "Live Like You Were Dying" and "Angel Boy" have a uniquely Christian flare. But again, they often are more about losing your way than the joys of faith.

Then again, McGraw's wife, Faith Hill, is a strong Baptist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://hollowverse.com/faith-hill/" title="Faith Hill&apos;s Religion and Political Views">[3]</a> So whether or not he's devout, it's safe to say that Christianity is a big part of his life.


## Blue politics in a red genre

McGraw is a staunch Democrat in an industry populated largely by Republicans. It doesn't seem to have affected his ticket or record sales too much.

McGraw doesn't express his Democratic views so much with his wallet, having only donated $7,500 to the Democratic National Committee in 2004.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Tim_McGraw.php" title="Tim McGraw&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[4]</a> But he sure talks about it a lot. For example, McGraw really likes Bill Clinton. He said:

>I love Bill Clinton. I think we should make him king. I'm talking the red robe, the turkey leg – everything.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.icelebz.com/quotes/tim_mcgraw/" title="Tim McGraw quotes, quotations, phrases, words">[5]</a>

And Clinton returned the compliment, endorsing McGraw for the governor of Tennessee, even though McGraw only mentioned that he might like to run–someday. Clinton said:

>The Democrats need candidates whom people can relate to in a personal way, people who understand their lives and their concerns and share their values. And I think that's something Tim can do without even pretending.<a class="source-citation" href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/10840346#.UGDgShg1Y1g" title="Tim McGraw likes the sound of Gov. McGraw">[6]</a>

Wait, who's pretending. Are you pretending, Bill? Anyway, McGraw's loyalties go beyond Bill Clinton. He's a big fan of Obama too, saying:

>It's innate in me to be a blue-dog Democrat. I'm not saying I'm right or wrong, but that's what I am. My wife and I and our family will do everything we can to support Obama. I like his ideas, I like his energy, and I like the statement he would make for our country to the world.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20221865,00.html" title="The Two Sides of Tim McGraw">[7]</a>

McGraw has even broached the gay issue–something sort of revolutionary in country music. He appeared at the school of Asher Brown (the gay boy who killed himself after relentless bullying at school) in Houston, Texas to talk about tolerance.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/entertainment-news/2010/10/08/tim-mcgraw-talks-bullying-school" title="Tim McGraw Talks Bullying at School">[8]</a>
