Rupert Grint was born in Hertfordshire, England.

Grint hasn't expressed his religious views. Most Q&A sites seem to agree that he's Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebb.info/religion/rupertgrint" title="Religion of Rupert Grint">[1]</a> which is no surprise, considering he's a white Englishman. A clue to his denomination might be that he attended a Catholic school as a child.<a class="source-citation" href="http://movies.yahoo.com/person/rupert-grint/biography.html" title="Rupert Grint Biography">[2]</a>

## The absence of politics

Grint hasn't had much to say about politics either. He did, when talking about his love of punk music, indicate a possible interest in the idea of no government, saying:

>I love the madness behind [punk music]. The craziness, the passion. And the whole anarchist thing is quite cool.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.rupert-grint.us/wordpress/rupert-grint-quotes-words-of-wisdom/" title="Rupert Grint Quotes: Words of Wisdom">[3]</a>

However, he's young, rich, and famous and his pals Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson are both pretty liberal, so my guess is Grint is a gay rights promoting, environmentalist liberal.
