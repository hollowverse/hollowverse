Louis C.K., whose real name is Louis Szekely, was born in Washington D.C. and grew up between Mexico City and a suburb outside of Boston, Massachusetts.

Louis was raised a Catholic, but has given up on religion since the days of childhood faith and innocence.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.americamagazine.org/blog/entry.cfm?entry_id=3294" title="Louis C.K. Contemplates God">[1]</a>

C.K.'s comedy is possibly so popular because of its honesty. C.K. says the truth of things that we so often don't want to admit to ourselves. One example of this and his personal belief is when he said:

>I have a lot of beliefs, and I live by none of them – that's just the way I am… they make me feel good about who I am.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://advocatusatheist.blogspot.it/2011/12/quote-of-day-louis-ck.html" title="Quote of the Day: Louis C.K.">[2]</a>

He's basically saying he's a regular human being, but without all the ego. It's kind of impressive.

C.K. is a comedian–and a good one. Like a lot of good comedians, the line of what they really think and what they're doing for laughs is blurry, but as they say: All jokes have an element of truth.

C.K. is an agnostic and doesn't mind using the Bible for comedic purposes. His tirade about God being like "a shitty girlfriend" and "insecure" because he asked Abraham to kill his son to prove that Abraham loved him, then right as he was about to do it, chastised him for almost killing his son, is pure hilarity and might actually make you think about some of the hypocrisies of religion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://gawker.com/5627049/louie+ing-my-religion-finding-a-glory-hole" title="Louie-ing My Religion, Finding a Glory Hole">[3]</a>

The best is how he begins the joke. C.K. says:

>If there is a God, then that dude is an asshole.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://gawker.com/5627049/louie+ing-my-religion-finding-a-glory-hole" title="Louie-ing My Religion, Finding a Glory Hole">[4]</a>

## Politics of oneness

C.K. is all about the unification of politics–though my take would be that's he's socially liberal. He once said:

>Some things I think are very conservative, or very liberal. I think when someone falls into one category for everything, I'm very suspicious. It doesn't make sense to me that you'd have the same solution to every issue.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/01/louis-cks-political-philosophy.html" title="Louis CK&apos;s Political Philosophy">[5]</a>

But he's clearly pro-gay marriage–at least he doesn't think it should be such a big issue.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HtJ_sDRRVVI" title="Louis C.K. on gay marriage">[6]</a>

Then again, he wouldn't be too popular with hyper-liberal, occupy protestor, borderline socialists when he says things like:

>Sometimes it's in defense of the common person against the rich that think they're entitled to this shit, but also the idea that everybody has to get handouts and do whatever they want so that there's not supposed to be any struggle in life is also a lot of horse shit.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://andrewsullivan.thedailybeast.com/2012/01/louis-cks-political-philosophy.html" title="Louis CK&apos;s Political Philosophy">[7]</a>

In the end, C.K., probably like his take on God, doesn't think he's qualified (or that anyone is qualified) to answer life's tough questions properly. He thinks questions like "How should we govern a country?" are difficult, complex, and profound and that there isn't an easy answer like "Republican or Democrat." It's fairly enlightened actually.
