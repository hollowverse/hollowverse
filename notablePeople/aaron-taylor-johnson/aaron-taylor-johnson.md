Aaron Taylor-Johnson, formerly Aaron Johnson, was born and raised in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England.

I couldn't find one crumb to include in Taylor-Johnson's religion section. Usually I can find something to talk about even if it doesn't relate exactly to the spiritual–meditation, yoga, an "Oh my God!" in an interview, Twitter prayers.

But I couldn't find anything. There no indication that his wedding had any element of religion in it,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/201206258429/sam-taylor-wood-marries-aaron-johnson/" title="Sam Taylor-Wood marries Aaron Johnson.">[1]</a> and Taylor-Johnson doesn't even have a Twitter account. It's pretty grim, for sure.

Even though a predominantly Christian country, there are plenty of non-religious folks in England,<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_England" title="Religion in England.">[2]</a> and one can only assume that Taylor-Johnson is one of them.

As far as politics are concerned, Taylor-Johnson doesn't participate much in the partisan politics of the day, but does seem to have a feminist side. When he married filmmaker Sam Taylor-Wood, now Taylor-Johnson, the couple both took each other's names. About his own name change he said,

>I just don't see why women need to take the man's name. I wanted to be a part of her just as much as she wanted to be part of me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.celebitchy.com/250011/aaron_taylor_johnson_i_just_dont_see_why_women_need_to_take_the_mans_name/" title="Aaron Taylor Johnson: &apos;I just don&apos;t see why women need to take the man&apos;s name.&apos;">[3]</a>

That's very egalitarian of him. It might not be much, but it definitely appears to hint at a liberal worldview–that people deserve to be protected by the government from potential prejudice.
