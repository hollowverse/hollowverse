Waka Flocka Flame, whose real name isÂ Juaquin Malphurs, was born in Queens, New York and raised just outside Atlanta, Georgia.

Waka is a Christian and has a strong belief in God, but the jury's still out on what denomination. Whatever it is, he seems to hold it pretty close to his heart. When asked if he thinks about the influence he has on young people when he makes his music, he said he always thinks about it. He continued,

>But I feel like, that's God's plan. I can't stop God for what he's got planned and the information he wants a person to hear, honestly. And I feel like if I was doing all the way wrong, I wouldn't be doing what I'm doing because I'm a son of God. . . . I know right from wrong. Once you know right from wrong, you walk your path.<a class="source-citation" href="http://theurbandaily.com/2021601/waka-flocka-talks-chief-keef-god-and-obama/" title="Waka Flocka Talks Chief Keef, God, and Obama.">[1]</a>

And when another interviewer asked him what "Flocka Music" was, he said he wasn't quite clear on that himself. He said,

>I guess God got in it. I ain't playin' this. So I think God's playin' this. I don't know what's been goin' on with Him, but I'm just ridin' the ride.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.worldstarhiphop.com/videos/video.php?v=wshhz8VP47H4CN0T23Xz" title="Video: Waka Flocka Explains His Flock Music To Monique! &quot;God Is Playing This.&quot;">[2]</a>

He's not even taking credit for his hard work, like most believers in God-given talent do. So even though he doesn't talk about his faith a whole lot in his lyrics, God is clearly an essential and central figure in Waka's life.


## All Americans Is Mixed

Waka is liberal all the way, at least in the causes he openly supports. First, he's a big Obama supporter. And he says it's not about race. It's about which candidate is saying the right things:

>No matter if he's black. He's not actually black. He's American. . . . Americans is mixed, we never a solid race. . . . It's not the color that you are, it's the things you say out your mouth.<a class="source-citation" href="http://theurbandaily.com/2021601/waka-flocka-talks-chief-keef-god-and-obama/" title="Waka Flocka Talks Chief Keef, God, and Obama.">[3]</a>

He said he hopes Obama stops spending so much money on fighting wars, and uses some of that money to give more tax breaks to the middle class.<a class="source-citation" href="http://theurbandaily.com/2021601/waka-flocka-talks-chief-keef-god-and-obama/" title="Waka Flocka Talks Chief Keef, God, and Obama.">[4]</a> Admittedly, though, the 2012 election was his first time voting. He says he didn't vote before because it didn't seem like voting made a difference in his community. Now that he pays taxes, and a lot of them, it seems to matter a little more. He said,

>If you're from the streets, how can voting help your life? How can tax dollars help your life?. . . Taxes, medical, insurances, you don't need none of that. But when you start living like a civilized person, you got to follow the rules.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.102jamz.com/Waka-Flocka-Votes-For-First-Time--Now-That-He--s-A/11277227?pid=270929" title="Waka Flocka Votes For First Time, Now That He&apos;s A Tax Paying Citizen.">[5]</a>

Waka's also into promoting animal rights. He posed nude for PETA's "Ink, Not Mink" campaign, and he recorded a really cute [video](http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/180222/waka-flocka-flames-peta-ad-is-delightful-and-downright-endearing/) for the organization touting the benefits of adopting a pet.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.deathandtaxesmag.com/180222/waka-flocka-flames-peta-ad-is-delightful-and-downright-endearing/" title="Waka Flock Flame&apos;s PETA ad is delightful and downright endearing.">[6]</a>

I have a feeling Waka is only going to become more politically involved as the years pass. You'll keep us updated in the comments, won't you?
