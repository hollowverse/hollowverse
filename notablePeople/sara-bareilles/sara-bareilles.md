Sara Bareilles was born and raised in Eureka, California.

She was raised a Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Bareilles_Sara/ConcertReviews/2009/02/28/8568531-sun.html" title="The Church Of The Redeemer, Toronto – February 27, 2009">[1]</a> but you'd be hard-pressed to find any sort of statement of devotion. She does, however, seem to retain some of that classic Catholic guilt. When she had a performance at the Church of the Redeemer in Toronto, Canada, she lamented the inappropriateness of her attire, saying:

>I'm in church and I'm wearing stripper shoes – I'm going to hell. I'm hearing my shoes clicking on the altar.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/B/Bareilles_Sara/ConcertReviews/2009/02/28/8568531-sun.html" title="The Church Of The Redeemer, Toronto – February 27, 2009">[2]</a>

All signs point to Bareilles being none too religious. Not only has she managed to avoid discussing matters of faith with the press thus far, many speculate that her hit song, "King of Anything," is basically a diatribe about how annoying religious evangelists are to her.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://pastoralia.org/church/cultural-reality-check-sara-bareilles" title="Cultural reality check: Sara Barielles">[3]</a> She sings:

>You've got opinions, man/We're all entitled to 'em, but I never asked/So let me thank you for your time, and try not to waste anymore of mine/And get out of here fast.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://pastoralia.org/church/cultural-reality-check-sara-bareilles" title="Cultural reality check: Sara Barielles">[4]</a>

These lyrics could be interpreted a number of ways in this frame: perhaps she's nonreligious and doesn't want to hear it, or maybe she is religious and just isn't interested in opposing viewpoints.

Still, this mostly amounts to speculation and sadly, her true religious feelings remain a mystery. Keep us posted if you hear anything, readers.


## Politics of Love

Barielles moves in high political circles. She's performed at the G-20 Summit in 2009.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2010/1021/Sara-Bareilles-to-open-for-Obama-in-Vegas" title="Sara Barielles to open for Obama in Vegas">[5]</a> That's one of those meetings that anarchists, socialist and progressive liberals protest regularly–so take whatever meaning you want from that. She performed at Obama's White House during the 2010 Easter Egg role as well.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2010/1021/Sara-Bareilles-to-open-for-Obama-in-Vegas" title="Sara Barielles to open for Obama in Vegas">[6]</a>

Most recently, when Obama was fighting a bitter battle for the state of Nevada in 2012, Barielles helped him out by performing at a rally for the president in Las Vegas.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.lvrj.com/blogs/politics/Sara__Bareilles_Next_stop_Vegas____with_Obama_and_Reid.html" title="Sara Bareilles: Next stop, Vegas . . . with Obama and Reid">[7]</a>

Barielles' favorite cause–at least of the controversial variety–seems to be gay rights. She appeared in a star-studded [PSA](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dsmm7g6yua8), imploring President Obama to publicly support the institution of gay marriage. Well, he did.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://articles.cnn.com/2012-05-09/politics/politics_obama-same-sex-marriage_1_gay-marriage-civil-unions-word-marriage?_s=PM:POLITICS" title="Obama announces he supports same-sex marriage">[8]</a>
