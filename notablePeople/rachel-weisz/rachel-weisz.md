Rachel Weisz was born and raised in London, England.

Weisz is mostly Jewish by heritage. Her father wisely immigrated to England from Hungary before the outbreak of World War II and her mother, who was raised a Catholic in a convent, no less, converted to Judaism–though we're not sure why.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.magxone.com/uploads/2012/06/Rachel-Weisz-Vogue-UK-8.jpg" title="Rachel Weisz Vogue UK">[1]</a>

But Weisz doesn't seem too devout. In fact, as an actress, she once publicly mused that her Jewish name might be a liability:

>I was advised by an American agent when I was about 19 to change my surname. And I said 'Why? Jews run Hollywood.' He said 'Exactly.' He had a theory that all the executives think acting's a job for shiksas [non Jews]… In some way acting is prostitution, and Hollywood Jews don't want their own women to participate.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theoccidentalobserver.net/2011/07/how-rachel-weisz-wrecked-her-hollywood-prospects/" title="How Rachel Weisz wrecked her Hollywood prospects">[2]</a>

Furthermore, Weisz has expressed being a bit down on religion in general, saying:

>People still kill in the name of religion. We haven't evolved to the point where we're one tribe called humans.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/r/rachel_weisz_3.html" title="Rachel Weisz Qutoes">[3]</a>

That sounds rather idealistic, but not something that would come from the mouth of a devout Jew–or a devout anything for that matter. Rather, she implies that human evolution and progress will inevitably shed the violent shackles of religion.


## Not so radical anymore

We only have a bit of speculation to go on regarding Weisz' political views. She was described as a "radical feminist" when she was in college.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001838/bio" title="Rachel Weisz – Biography">[4]</a>

Couple that with her quote about sometimes fantasizing about being a hippie that travels around in a mobile home, going to festivals and having "millions of children" with "dreadlocks and nose rings,"<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/r/rachel_weisz_3.html" title="Rachel Weisz Quotes">[5]</a> and we could assume that she is quite liberal.

But she did once describe her character in the film, The Constant Gardner, as a "bleeding heart liberal [and an] annoying troublemaker, pain in the arse 'left' kind of girl.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/03/us-rachelweisz-idUSTRE7723AR20110803" title="A Minute With: Rachel Weisz on being a whistleblower">[6]</a> So, it's hard to say.
