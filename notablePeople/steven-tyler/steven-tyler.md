Steven Tyler, originally Steven Victor Tallarico, was born in Yonkers, New York.

Tyler was raised Catholic and his mother was a teacher at a Catholic school.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.wetpaint.com%2Famerican-idol%2Fcast%2Fsteven-tyler" title="Steven Tyler – American Idol">[1]</a>

Tyler certainly doesn't seem to be Catholic (except for some major guilt regarding an ex-girlfriend and an abortion)<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nationalreview.com%2Farticles%2F266316%2Fpost-abortion-trauma-kevin-burke" title="Post-Abortion Trauma – Kevin Burke">[2]</a> Really, Tyler seems to be more on the side of New Age-y, post-modern spirituality–but with a little Greek mythology thrown into the mix. First of all, Tyler considers himself a realist,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fvoices.yahoo.com%2Fmemorable-facts-oprah-winfreys-steven-tyler-interview-10780859.html%3Fcat%3D33" title="Memorable Facts from Oprah Winfrey&apos;s Steven Tyler interview">[3]</a> so just keep that in mind when reading what follows.

Tyler, understandably so, says he found God in music.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fvoices.yahoo.com%2Fmemorable-facts-oprah-winfreys-steven-tyler-interview-10780859.html%3Fcat%3D33" title="Memorable Facts from Oprah Winfrey&apos;s Steven Tyler interview">[4]</a> He's a musician, and a good one. He said:

>I think I put together the beauty of Mother Nature and music and somewhere in that I felt the presence of God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnews.yahoo.com%2Ftop-10-steven-tyler-quotes-oprahs-next-chapter-220000354.html" title="The Top 10 Steven Tyler Quotes from His &apos;Oprah&apos;s Next Chapter&apos; Interview With Oprah">[5]</a>

He also said that his first spiritual experience was with what might be described as "wood sprites." He said:

>I saw this place in the woods where the sun was coming through and I'm walking around with my slingshot at nine years old… It was so quiet in there I thought I heard something called the children of the woods. It was my first spiritual moment… and I've always been writing songs to try to get back to that moment.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.starpulse.com%2Fnews%2Findex.php%2F2012%2F02%2F29%2Fwood_sprites_gave_steven_tyler_his_fir" title="Wood Sprites Gave Steven Tyler His &apos;First Spiritual Experience&apos; As A Child">[6]</a>

Beyond that, Tyler admits to practicing the sex rituals of famous British occultist (made more famous by the Ozzy Osbourne song of the same name) Aleister Crowley. He said:

>I've practiced Crowley Magick so I know it works. I'm not saying that every girl I slept with came at the same time or that I asked her to pray for the same thing I was praying for; namely that Aerosmith would become the greatest American band.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fac2012.com%2F2011%2F05%2F22%2Fthanks-steven-tyler%2F" title="Thanks Steven Tyler!">[7]</a>

It would also be a fair assumption to think that Tyler, at the very least, believes in a higher power, considering he has been in and out of rehab for decades, including extensive work with Alcoholics Anonymous.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.noisecreep.com%2F2012%2F01%2F03%2Fsteven-tyler-opens-up-to-oprah-winfrey-about-drug-addiction%2F" title="Steven Tyler Opens Up To Oprah Winfrey About Drug Addiction">[8]</a>

## Rock politics

There's not much here from Tyler. He won't discuss his political views with the public–or he doesn't have any. You don't have to when your a multimillionaire rock star. He does exhibit signs of being somewhat socially conservative–beyond the abortion guilt. He's OK with censoring television, saying profanity and nudity is not classy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F01%2F10%2Fsteven-tyler-for-fcc-tv-c_n_1196126.html" title="Steven Tyler For FCC TV Censorship, He Tells Supreme Court">[9]</a>

He's commented that Obama sings well, but never approved or disapproved of his politics<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fmusic.yahoo.com%2Fblogs%2Freality-rocks%2Frandy-jackson-steven-tyler-critique-president-obama-singing-223643659.html" title="Randy Jackson &amp; Steven Tyler Critique Obama&apos;s Singing">[10]</a> and he sang (or murdered depending on who you ask) the U.S. National Anthem at a football game,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fmusic.yahoo.com%2Fblogs%2Freality-rocks%2Frandy-jackson-steven-tyler-critique-president-obama-singing-223643659.html" title="Steven Tyler National Anthem Performance Mocked">[11]</a> but none of this points to any political affiliation, so we're just going to have to label Tyler non-political and slightly conservative.
