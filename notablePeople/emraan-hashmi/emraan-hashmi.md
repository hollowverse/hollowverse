Emraan Hashmi was born and raised in Mumbai, India.

Hashmi was raised by a Muslim father and a Catholic mother.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.koimoi.com/actor/emraan-hashmi/" title="Emraan Hashmi biography">[1]</a> It appears his upbringing was more Muslim, though.<a class="source-citation" href="http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-13/news-interviews/37059272_1_actor-emraan-hashmi-religion-puja" title="I am not against any religion: Emraan Hashmi">[2]</a> And occasionally, he is spotted participating in Muslim ritual and ceremony. This [photo](http://www.bollywoodlife.com/pics/emraan-hashmi-gets-religious/) shows him at a "dargah," which is a Sufi Muslim ritual performed at the burial site of Suffi saints.<a class="source-citation" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dargah" title="Dargah">[3]</a>

Hashmi appears to be fairly open religiously. He married a Hindu woman and has mentioned that she practices her faith in their shared home, (([I am not against any religion: Emraan Hashmi](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-13/news-interviews/37059272_1_actor-emraan-hashmi-religion-puja). Times of India.)) and he's willing to observe (not necessarily participate) in Hindu spiritual ceremonies such as the Kumbh Mela where tens of millions of Hindus take a pilgrimage to bathe in a holy river.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/bollywood/news/a457433/emraan-hashmi-refuses-to-do-religious-ritual-for-ek-thi-daayan.html" title="Emraan Hashmi refuses to do religious ritual for &apos;Ek Thi Daayan&apos;?">[4]</a> He said:

>I'm not against any religion… so, how can I have anything against Hinduism or Islam or any other religion. I went to Kumbh to enjoy it and see for myself what happens there. Not one should analyse it or dissect my visit too much. ((,[I am not against any religion: Emraan Hashmi](http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2013-02-13/news-interviews/37059272_1_actor-emraan-hashmi-religion-puja),. Times of India.))

It would seem that there are those who take issue with his religion. This multi-millionaire Bollywood star was denied entry into a posh housing community because, Hashmi alleges, they discriminated against his Muslim faith.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.indianexpress.com/news/emraan-hashmi-alleges-religious-bias-in-flat-ownership/496516/" title="Emraan Hashmi alleges religious bias in flat ownership">[5]</a>

Ultimately, Hashmi seems to be open and laid back about religion–a symbol of an emerging modern, diverse India.


## Politics. Maybe?

As far as I can tell, Hashmi is fairly non-political. If he is, then it's buried in a pile of Hindi. Besides, I have a real hard time understanding Indian politics. This satire site said he was nominated for the President of India–and they fooled me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theunrealtimes.com/2012/06/14/sonia-proposes-emraan-hashmi%E2%80%99s-candidacy-for-president-to-counter-mamata-mulayam/" title="Sonia proposes Emraan Hashmi&apos;s candidature for President to counter Mamata-Mulayam">[6]</a>

There's not even much in the way of charity or philanthropy coming from Hashmi. He played a cricket match for the IIFA Foundation,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.contactmusic.com/photo/bollywood_cricket_12_wenn1366965" title="Emraan Hashmi The IIFA Foundation Charity Celebrity Cricket Match held at Headingley Carnegie Stadium Leeds, England">[7]</a> an organization dedicated to helping the families of film crew workers who are adversely affected by their breadwinner's absence.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.iifa.com/charity_trust.html" title="IIFA">[8]</a> Certainly not at all political.
