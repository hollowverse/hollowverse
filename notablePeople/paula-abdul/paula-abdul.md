Paula Abdul was born in San Fernando, California.

Both of her parents are Jewish. Her father is a middle-eastern Jew who emigrated to Brazil and then the United States and her mother, a Canadian woman whose Jewish ancestry is from Eastern Europe. Abdul explained it herself, saying:

>My father is a Syrian Jew whose family immigrated to Brazil. My mother is Canadian with Jewish roots. My dream is to come to Israel for a real holiday.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3328923,00.html" title="Israel Minister, American Ido">[1]</a>

She got her wish and was invited to a vacation in Israel by Israeli Tourist Minister Isaac Herzog over the Hanukah Holiday Season in 2006.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3328923,00.html" title="Israel Minister, American Ido">[2]</a>

Abdul was described by her own rabbi, Chaim Mentz, as a "good Jewish girl" and it is reported that she practices by regularly attending services and lighting Sabbath candles.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1yYrLwO0cIk" title="Paula Abdul… &quot;a good Jewish girl.&quot;">[3]</a> She has also spoken about bonding with some of the Jewish American Idol contestants over religion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.nndb.com/people/883/000025808/" title="Paula Abdul">[4]</a>

## Politics cuts into my drinking time!

Abdul is not well-known for her discourse on politics or society. She claims that she's not stupid, though, saying:

>I'm intelligent…I have a brain.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.buzzfeed.com/mjs538/paula-abdul-i-am-intelligent" title="Paula Abdul: &apos;I Have a Brain And Have Never Been Drunk in My Life.">[5]</a>

She doesn't show it much.

Abdul is heavily involved in various charities–signaling a desire to create a better world and society–but most of them, if not all, involve non-political topics.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/737-paula-abdul" title="Paula Abdul">[6]</a>

She did signal extreme satisfaction when Barack Obama was elected as president in 2008, saying:

>I was crying [when I heard Obama had won]! You feel such a sense of pride that you can't even articulate how good you feel. It's unbelievable! I have chills. I was just so excited. I was texting everyone: 'Peace has begun.' And then I was texting everyone, 'I don't have to move to Vancouver now!'<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20238768,00.html" title="Paula Abdul: Obama Victory Triggers Tears and Texting">[7]</a>

I guess we can call her a Democrat, but, unfortunately, that's the only evidence.
