Wiz Khalifa, whose real name is Cameron Jibril Thomaz, was born in North Dakota, but having grown up in a military family, he lived in such far-flung places as Germany and Japan. He now calls Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania his home.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.formatmag.com/features/wiz-khalifa/" title="Wiz Khalifa">[1]</a>

It's unclear if Khalifa considers himself a Muslim. But Khalifa is an Arabic word, which translates to "successor" or leader. Khalifa's Muslim grandfather gave him the name. He says:

>And 'Khalifa' is Arabic for 'successor' and 'leader' and my granddad is Muslim, so he gave me that name; he felt like that's what I was doing with my music.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.digitalspy.com/music/news/a311148/wiz-khalifa-i-got-name-tattoo-at-17.html" title="Wiz Khalifa: &apos;I got name tattoo at 17.&apos;">[2]</a>

My interpretation is that Wiz probably likes to say he's Muslim for attention, but doesn't really identify with the religion.


## Politics of the Wiz

Wiz doesn't talk much about his political views. He does take a stance on one very important issue, though–weed. Khalifa, along with Snoop Dogg, has endorsed the legalization of marijuana.<a class="source-citation" href="http://kysdc.com/2624742/wiz-khalifa-and-snoop-dogg-talk-marriage-and-politics-exclusive-video/" title="Wiz Khalifa and Snoop Dogg talk marriage and politics.">[3]</a>

I suppose we could designate him a liberal–or maybe a libertarian as a result. Still, it's more likely that he just likes getting high. But he's a thoughtful young man, and perhaps the idea of civil liberties has crossed his mind.

He looks pretty happy about getting the news that Obama won re-election in 2012 as you can see in this [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLhY8pKCOcQ&feature=youtu.be&t=3m46s). So, that has me leaning toward liberal.
