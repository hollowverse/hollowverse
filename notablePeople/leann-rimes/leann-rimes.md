LeAnn Rimes, who added the surname Cibrian after getting married, was born in Jackson, Mississippi and raised mostly in Garland, Texas.

Rimes is really into God, especially that whole forgiveness part. After the tabloid-exposed affair she had with a married man while married herself, and the angry outcry that followed from her fans,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://voices.yahoo.com/leann-rimes-affair-cheating-songstress-claims-opinions-6365394.html" title="LeAnn Times Affair — Cheating Songstress Claims &quot;Opinions Have No Bearing on My Life.&quot;">[1]</a> that's pretty understandable.

She's a Christian, seemingly of the non-denominational sort. Or, I should say, the only church I could find that she attended was the Kardashian non-denominational Life Change Community Church<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2097379/LeAnn-Rimes-Kim-Kardashian-bond-bible-study-attend-church-together.html" title="LeAnn Rimes and Kim Kardashian bond over bible study and attend church together.">[2]</a> (now the California Community Church) which is all about forgiveness and second chances.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.californiacommunitychurch.com/" title="About California Community Church.">[3]</a>

She's also all over Twitter about God. After the elementary school shooting in Connecticut in 2012 that left many Americans doing some soul-searching, Rimes tweeted,

>One day, I hope to ask God "why?"<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/leannrimes/status/279688690513620992" title="leannrimes: One day, I hope to ask God &quot;why?&quot;">[4]</a>

But she also retweets more upbeat, inspirational quotes from others. Here's one about forgiveness:

>God's grace can impact anyone, no sin is beyond the reach of His forgiveness.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/leannrimes" title="LeAnn Rimes Cibrian (leannrimes) on Twitter.">[5]</a>

Whether she turned to God after the affair, or if she felt connected to Him all along, I can't be sure. But it certainly seems to be a driving force these days.


## It's not politics, it's a job

Most people think Rimes is a Republican,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2012/08/the-20-hottest-celebrity-republicans/leann-rimes" title="LeAnn Rimes – The 20 Hottest Celebrity Republicans.">[6]</a> but I'm not buying it. She did perform at a Republican fundraiser in 2011, which incidentally netted only $650 (of the $200,000+ raised at the event, Rimes and her entourage were paid $155,000).<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2011/04/15/112257/lavish-republican-fundraiser-with.html" title="Lavish Republican fundraiser with LeAnn Rimes nets $650.">[7]</a>

But when someone asked her on Twitter why she played the event, she said her decision to play wasn't a political one:

>It's a job! I'm entertainment, not making a political stance.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1101/rimes_on_gop_party_its_a_job.html" title="Rimes on GOP party: &apos;It&apos;s a job!&apos;">[8]</a>

Then she went on to say that she has also played at events for Democrats, and she didn't think celebrities should influence fans' political views.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.politico.com/click/stories/1101/rimes_on_gop_party_its_a_job.html" title="Rimes on GOP party: &apos;It&apos;s a job!&apos;">[9]</a>

And in fact, the only political issue she seems readily willing to discuss, is gay rights. She supports gay marriage,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.trn1.com/RIMES-MARRIAGE-01" title="Pop/Country Superstar LeAnn Rimes on Gay Marriage: &quot;It&apos;s About Equality.&quot;">[10]</a> and she's very involved in LGBT organizations. She participated in the NoH8 campaign, which aims to promote gay rights issues through photographs of celebrities who support the cause. And she recorded a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AKD561oGZxc) for the It Gets Better campaign, which hopes to combat teen suicide rates through personal testimonies recorded by celebrities stating that things get better in adulthood.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=49937" title="LeAnn Rimes Talks Equality, Motherhood and &apos;Gay&apos; Ex Rumors.">[11]</a>

Talking about why she's interested in LGBT issues, she said,

>I believe in equality. Everybody should be treated exactly the same way no matter what their race, no matter what their sexuality.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.pridesource.com/article.html?article=49937" title="LeAnn Rimes Talks Equality, Motherhood and &apos;Gay&apos; Ex Rumors.">[12]</a>

From all that, I'm going to assume that Rimes is mostly liberal, on social issues anyway. But, she's also not opposed to entertaining either side for a paycheck.
