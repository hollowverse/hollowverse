Jimmy Carter was born and raised in Plains, Georgia.

Carter is often described as the most religious man to grace the office of the presidency.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/most_religious_president_jimmy_carter_james_garfield_or_john_quincy_adams_.html" title="Most religious president: Jimmy Carter, James Garfield, or John Quincy Adams?">[1]</a> He was raised a Southern Baptist,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.adherents.com/people/pc/Jimmy_Carter.html" title="The Religion of President Jimmy Carter.">[2]</a> attends church everywhere he travels, teaches Sunday school, prays every day, performed missionary work as an adult<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2012/09/most_religious_president_jimmy_carter_james_garfield_or_john_quincy_adams_.html" title="Most religious president: Jimmy Carter, James Garfield, or John Quincy Adams?">[3]</a> . . . the list goes on.

In his 1976 campaign for the presidency, Jimmy Carter revealed to the world that he was an evangelical born-again Christian. Although most of us are familiar with that term now, at the time he had reporters scrambling for their dictionaries trying to figure out what it meant.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/jesus/president/religion.html" title="President And His Faith – Religion In The White House – Then And Now.">[4]</a>

But Carter hasn't always agreed wholeheartedly with his Baptist brethren. Although he continues to practice in that denomination, he left the Southern Baptist Convention in 2000 because he disagreed with several issues including the idea that "women have to be subservient to men."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theird.org/page.aspx?pid=2351" title="Jimmy Carter Interviewed by Albert Mohler.">[5]</a> He said,

>At its most repugnant, the belief that women must be subjugated to the wishes of men excuses slavery, violence, forced prostitution, genital mutilation and national laws that omit rape as a crime. But it also costs many millions of girls and women control over their own bodies and lives, and continues to deny them fair access to education, health, employment and influence within their own communities.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.theage.com.au/opinion/losing-my-religion-for-equality-20090714-dk0v.html" title="Losing my religion for equality.">[6]</a>

But he also believed vehemently in the separation of church and state–a concept he believes is supported by the Bible itself.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,179825,00.html" title="The Role of Faith in President Jimmy Carter&apos;s Life.">[7]</a> So although he did not believe Jesus would approve of abortion, he felt it his duty to enforce its legality because the Supreme Court upheld it as the law of the land.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,179825,00.html" title="The Role of Faith in President Jimmy Carter&apos;s Life.">[8]</a>

Carter's religious faith guides every aspect of his life, and was intimately entwined with his duty as president. He said,

>We have a responsibility to try to shape government so that it does exemplify the teaching of God.<a class="source-citation" href="http://news21.com/story/2007/08/23/religion_in_the_white_house" title="Religion in the White House.">[9]</a>

## Waging Peace, A Peanut Farmer in Washington

It was that Christian morality that guided his political action, and some say, contributed to his naivete in the harsh world of Washington politics.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/carter-transcript/" title="Complete Program Transcript. Jimmy Carter. WGBH American Experience.">[10]</a>

Carter, a Democrat, championed energy independence and conservation while president, expanded the national parks system, created the Department of Education, and appointed more minorities and women than anyone before him.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/jimmycarter" title="James Carter.">[11]</a> He also negotiated the Panama Canal Treaty, handing over control of the waterway to that country,<a class="source-citation" href="http://billofrightsinstitute.org/resources/educator-resources/lessons-plans/presidents/panama-canal/" title="Panama Canal Treaties: Jimmy Carter.">[12]</a> successfully negotiated an arms treaty with the Soviet Union, and helped broker an unprecedented peace agreement between Israel and Egypt.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/carter-peace/" title="Peace Talks at Camp David, September 1978. Jimmy Carter. WGBH American Experience.">[13]</a>

But his presidency ultimately became defined by a struggling economy, increased inflation and interest rates, an energy crisis, and the Iran hostage crisis which lasted over one year and only ended the day Carter left office.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/carter-hostage-crisis/" title="The Iran Hostage Crisis. Jimmy Carter. WGBH American Experience.">[14]</a>

Despite his overwhelming defeat to Ronald Reagan in 1980, Carter became one of the most active former presidents his country has known. In 1982 he established The Carter Center, an organization dedicated to "waging peace" throughout the world through conflict resolution and the promotion of human rights issues. He has gone on diplomatic missions for every post-Reagan administration, and has published several books on how to achieve peace in the Middle East.<a class="source-citation" href="http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2008-12-03-jimmy-carter-book_N.htm" title="Jimmy Carter writes new book on Middle East.">[15]</a> In 2002 he won the Nobel Peace Prize for his work.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/carter-post-presidency/" title="Jimmy Carter&apos;s Post-Presidency. Jimmy Carter. WGBH American Experience.">[16]</a>

Carter's insistence on doing the right thing without regard to political nuance hampered his ability to be a greatly successful president, and probably cost him a second term. But his life as a presidential veteran has proved greatly influential and perhaps the role in which his Christian spirit of love for one's brothers and sisters across the globe could truly be realized.
