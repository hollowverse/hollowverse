Katharine McPhee was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

McPhee appears to be a moderately religious person. It's hard to get a line on exactly what faith she subscribes to. Evidence seems to conflict. For example, she was educated at a Catholic institution, Notre Dame high school in Sherman Oaks, California.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1897713/bio" title="Katherine McPhee – Biography">[1]</a> And she does have some Irish ancestry,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://web.archive.org/web/20070830182026/http://www.weareellisisland.org/stories/view/36" title="Save Ellis Island: Katherine McPhee">[2]</a> so Catholic seems a reasonable leap.

However, she and her husband, Nick Cokas, were married in a Presbyterian ceremony.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20175795,00.html" title="Katherine McPhee Marries Producer Boyfriend">[3]</a> Either it was at the behest of her beau, or she's a Presbyterian, or she just doesn't care either way. Hard to say.

There was a time when McPhee was rumored to be a Scientologist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blog.beliefnet.com/idolchatter/2006/05/does-katherine-mcphee-idolize.html" title="Does Katherine McPhee Idolize Scientology">[4]</a> McPhee addressed the rumors, admitting that she did attend some Scientology functions, meetings, rituals and even gave them a large portion of her money–but it was all in pursuit of a love interest, and when that fizzled, so did her interest in Scientology.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zCPKKarq48" title="Katherine McPhee talks about her Scientologist ex-boyfriend">[5]</a>

She does have faith, and it's a Christian faith judging from the occasional Bible tweet on her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/katharinemcphee). She said that during times of uncertainty in her career, she just fell back on her faith and things worked out:

>I'm a spiritual person. I truly believe that God provides. So, next thing I knew, I got a Neutrogena contract.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.menshealth.com/women-of-mh/models/katharine-mcphee" title="Katherine McPhee">[6]</a>

Plus, she counts going to church as one of her favorite ways to spend her Sunday mornings.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.parade.com/celebrity/sunday-with/2012/02/05-katharine-mcphee.html" title="&apos;Smash&apos; Star Katherine McPhee on Romance and Channeling Marilyn">[7]</a> If only we knew which church!


## Not idolizing who many idolize

I think I'm about to surprise you… well, maybe not. Let's just say I was surprised. It appears that Katharine McPhee is a Republican.

At first, I thought it was just standard, classy celebrity silence how she made no comments about Obama, or how she actively avoided paparazzi questions about same-sex marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.celebuzz.com/video-katharine-mcphees-got-new-s106141/" title="Katherine McPhee&apos;s Got A New Friend">[8]</a>

Then, I thought it was rumor that people had listed her among their "Republican Idols."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1Q685V1yvM" title="Hot Brunette Katherine McPhee – My Republican Idols">[9]</a>

Finally, the proof-filled pudding doughnut of campaign contributions reared it's head. McPhee donated over $1,000 to the McCain-Palin Republican presidential campaign in 2008. And that's it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.newsmeat.com/fec/bystate_detail.php?last=McPhee&first=Katharine" title="Katherine McPhee&apos;s Federal Campaign contribution search results">[10]</a>

I mean, there's nothing wrong with it. She must have some strong opinions to defy the vast majority of her entertainment industry cohorts. I wish she'd expand on them. All I've got is her making a recommendation to American Idol contestants to keep their sexuality to themselves.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2010/01/11/kat-mcphee-tells-idols-stay-closet" title="Kat McPhee Tells Idols To Stay In Closet">[11]</a> She said:

>You don't need to wear your religion on your sleeve. The competition is not about your faith or your sexuality but about you as an artist.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.advocate.com/news/daily-news/2010/01/11/kat-mcphee-tells-idols-stay-closet" title="Kat McPhee Tells Idols To Stay In Closet">[12]</a>

That could just be good advice, but interesting nonetheless. What do y'all think?
