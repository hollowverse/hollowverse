Rebecca Black was born and raised in Anaheim Hills, California.

Well, let me just say that, just as the lyrics to her viral hit "Friday" don't get very deep, neither do her religious beliefs. But we'll do our best for you anyway. Her Mexican heritage<a class="source-citation" href="#http://ethnicelebs.com/rebecca-black" title="Rebecca Black.">[1]</a> might suggest a Catholic upbringing, but there's no evidence to support that.

The rumors around the internet favor her being a Mormon.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20110425041608AAqni4Z" title="Is Rebecca Black Mormon?">[2]</a> But again, no sources behind that claim.

Most likely she's either not religious at all, or she's vaguely religious but it's not a huge part of her life. Or maybe she just likes partyin' partyin' yeah.


## She so excited . . . about Mexican politics

Black won't be of voting age until 2015, but that didn't stop her from endorsing Mexican presidential hopeful and PRI politician Enrique Peña Nieto. To be clear, she is neither a citizen of the country nor is she even eligible to vote yet in her own country. But apparently the endorsement still warranted a press conference where she said Peña Nieto "is going to do a fantastic job." She also talked about all the support she receives in her mother's home country:

>I'm so glad to kind of be home because I have so much family and so much support here from my family. I don't have very much in the U.S.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xj1Xj2NgcUc" title="Rebecca Black Supports corrupt Mexican politician Enrique Peña Nieto.">[3]</a>

Maybe she interprets the 921,598 dislikes of her "Friday" [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kfVsfOSbJY0)(that's just as of the writing of this article, I'm sure there will be more. . .) as not getting support from her home country–although undoubtedly those dislikes came from all over the world. But I digress. Her interest in the politics of Mexico doesn't seem to translate into an interest in immigration policy in the U.S. I found no comments from her on the [Dream Act](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DREAM_Act) or Arizona's controversial [Senate Bill 1070](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SB_1070).

But maybe this endorsement is an indication of things to come for the young pop sensation. Well, I have to say, if that means more of Rebecca Black in our future, then we we we so excited.
