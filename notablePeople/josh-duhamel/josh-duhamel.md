Josh Duhamel was born and raised in Minot, North Dakota.

Duhamel is a Catholic. He's certainly not the type to publicly praise God or credit the Almighty for his success in the entertainment business. However, he's not averse to mentioning his faith during interviews–mostly in relation to his wife, pop singer Fergie, who is also a Catholic. He said:

>We're both Catholic. There were a lot of things that were really compatible between us. But at the end of the day, she's just an amazing girl.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2219918%2FFergie-admits-infidelity-claim-rocked-marriage-Josh-Duhamel--steps-fierce-claw-hands.html" title="You wouldn&apos;t want to cross her! Fergie tells Oprah how infidelity claim rocked her marriage to Josh Duhamel… as she steps out with fierce claw hands">[1]</a>

The two were married in a Catholic ceremony,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usmagazine.com%2Fcelebrities%2Fjosh-duhamel" title="Josh Duhamel bio">[2]</a> they go to church on Sundays when they aren't too busy working<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parade.com%2Fcelebrity%2F2010%2F09%2Fthe-softer-side-of-josh-duhamel.html" title="The Softer Side of Josh Duhamel">[3]</a> and he's spoken of wanting to raise that classic large Catholic brood with his wife, saying:

>We're both from Catholic families we like to procreate!<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.okmagazine.com%2Fvideos%2Fjosh-duhamel-strong-man-tights-ellen-degeneres" title="Josh Duhamel is a (Strong) Man in Tights on &apos;Ellen Degeneres.&apos;">[4]</a>

So, I'd say he's relatively devout.


## Subtly diplomatic

Politically, Duhamel isn't so forthcoming. He is clearly political and cares about the importance of participation in a democracy. His twitter feed during the days leading up to the 2012 U.S. elections hosted numerous messages to his fans to get out and vote.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjoshduhamel" title="Josh Duhamel (joshduhamel) on Twitter">[5]</a> and some of his fans expressed their appreciation for him keeping things non-partisan. One tweeted:

>voted for the first time! Thanks for The push to vote not who to vote for!" Thank you for letting your voice be heard!<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjoshduhamel" title="Josh Duhamel (joshduhamel) on Twitter">[6]</a>

The one time Duhamel explicitly endorsed a political position was in favor of the Congressional Reform Act of 2012, in which it was proposed that (gasp!) members of Congress be subject to the same rules, laws and conventions as the rest of society. Duhamel posted a copy of the the meat of the bill with this tweet:

>I'm not usually political but this is something that I believe could change our direction as a country. If you agree RT<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjoshduhamel%2Fstatus%2F243068750079860736" title="joshduhamel: I&apos;m not usually political, but…">[7]</a>

It would seem such a bill would be non-partisan–just common sense. However, Duhamel was the victim of a bit of a hoax. The bill is not real and is full of innacuracies about how Congress operates.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usnews.com%2Fopinion%2Fblogs%2Fsusan-milligan%2F2012%2F03%2F13%2Fwarren-buffett-and-the-mythical-congressional-reform-act" title="Warren Buffet and the Mythical &apos;Congressional Reform Act.&apos;">[8]</a> Still, it's a nice idea.
