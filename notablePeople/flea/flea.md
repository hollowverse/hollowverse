Flea, whose real name is Michael Peter Balzary, was born in the Melbourne suburb of Mount Waverley, Australia and grew up in Larchmont, New York and Los Angeles, California.

He has not spoken about his religious views much, nor the religion of his upbringing–if there was one. Based on various quotes, it appears he might fall into the "spiritual, not religious" category. He once tweeted:

>I love god I don't trust religion.<a class="source-citation" href="https://twitter.com/flea333/status/239899969765642240" title="Flea333: i love god i don&apos;t trust religion">[1]</a>

When asked if he is spiritual he answered:

>There is a spiritual path in my life, I follow a long time. This is an important part of who I am…I'm not religious at all. But I believe in divine power, to something like a divine intelligence.<a class="source-citation" href="http://stadium-arcadium.com/04-09-2011/flea-interview-stern-de-cologne-germany-september-4th-2011-im-with-you-tour/red-hot-chili-peppers-news/article10752" title="Flea interview with Stern.de after Cologne Theatre Show.">[2]</a>

Flea seems to follow his own course toward spiritual happiness, rejecting the tenets of organized religion.


## Bug politics

Flea appeared in a star-studded [video ](http://obeygiant.com/voteforchange/flea/)series called "Vote for Change", where he strongly and passionately endorsed Barack Obama for president in 2012, saying:

>I love the United States of America. But these last years, it has been less of a place to love then I hoped that it could be. And I hope that Barack Obama can bring about the change for it to be a place to love wholly and fully with all that I am.<a class="source-citation" href="http://obeygiant.com/voteforchange/flea/" title="Flea – Vote For Change">[3]</a>

So, we can be assured that he leans toward the Democratic side of the fence.

Furthermore, arguments can be made that Flea is pretty liberal. His best friend and bandmate, Anthony Kiedis, has admitted to being sexually experimental and some might classify him as bi-sexual.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.feelnumb.com/2011/08/26/anthony-kiedis-and-dave-navarro-kissing/" title="Anthony Kiedis and Dave Navarro Kissing">[4]</a> When Obama came out in support of gay marriage, Flea took the opportunity at a Washington D.C. performance to make a comment, saying:

>All this sanity – I like it!<a class="source-citation" href="http://storify.com/carlpierre/red-hot-chili-peppers-rock-out-in-d-c" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers Rock Out in D.C., Twitter Explodes with California Love">[5]</a>

Plus, all the art, funk-pop antics of being almost naked on stage,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06Dql7EiMWE" title="Red Hot Chili Peppers – Right on time (Sox on cox)">[6]</a> the drugs and everything else that rock stars do<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/feb/14/artsfeatures.popandrock" title="Interview: The Red Hot Chili Peppers">[7]</a> doesn't exactly foster a conservative worldview.
