Cher Lloyd grew up in Malvern, Worcestershire, England.

Lloyd doesn't talk about religion, making me think she's probably not religious in the least. On top of that, of the many tattoos that cover her body, none of them are religious in nature.<a class="source-citation" href="http://stealherstyle.net/tattoos/cher-lloyd-tattoos/" title="Cher Lloyd&apos;s Tattoos &amp; Meanings.">[1]</a>

She did once compare God to Simon Cowell, a notoriously harsh judge on the TV show The X Factor, on which Lloyd was a contestant. And it reveals her view of God not as a particularly benevolent or loving one:

>I'm scared to death of Simon sometimes, in a good way! . . . He's got this look, he's so powerful it's unreal, if he looks at you in that way I nearly die. He's like God.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/846672-cher-lloyd-simon-cowell-is-like-god-but-ill-still-tell-him-how-it-is" title="Cher Lloyd: Simon Cowell is like God but I&apos;ll still tell him how it is.">[2]</a>

So maybe she's more of an Old Testament girl? Or maybe, which is most likely the case, she doesn't think too much about it.


## From 'Pikey' Taunts to Political Message

Lloyd is generally silent on the topic of politics as well, except for one issue: bullying. As a Roma or gypsy, the young singer has been the target of racism her whole life.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/x-factor-cher-lloyd-used-791734" title="X Factor: Cher Lloyd used to live in a caravan and suffered &apos;pikey&apos; taunts.">[3]</a> But after she entered the public eye through reality TV, and revealed a strong personality that didn't endear her to her audience, the bullying climbed to a new level–at one concert she was pelted with bottles of urine.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2012/aug/20/cher-lloyd-v-festival" title="Cher Lloyd pelted with bottles of urine at V festival.">[4]</a>

After stating that she is called a "dirty pikey" many times a day, she said that online bullying got so bad that she was afraid someone was going to physically hurt her:

>When I was getting all this abuse, I became completely cut off from everything. I didn't want to go out of the house, I didn't want to speak to anyone. I didn't want to do anything just in case something really bad happened to me.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.mtv.co.uk/news/cher-lloyd/347053-cher-lloyd-online-bullying-x-factor-radio-1" title="Cher Lloyd &apos;Fears For Her Safety&apos; After Online Bullying.">[5]</a>

She decided to start speaking out about the issue in the hopes that something can be done to combat it both for celebrities and other people–and she said she thought the government should have a role.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.sugarscape.com/main-topics/celebrities/662092/cher-lloyd-cyber-bullying-disgusts-me?page=0%2C0" title="Cher Lloyd: Cyber bullying disgusts me.">[6]</a>

No other words from Lloyd on political affiliations or major political issues, but government intervention in bullying sounds like she could be a good fit for the Labour party. What do you think? My guess is that strong personality will lend itself to some more opinions in the future.
