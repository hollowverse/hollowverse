Cody Simpson was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. He moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was thirteen to pursue his music career.

Simpson is definitely a Christian, but what denomination remains a mystery. There is a healthy Catholic population in his home state in Australia,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://profile.id.com.au/Default.aspx?id=400&pg=106&gid=130&type=enum" title="Religion – Queensland – Australia Community Profile.">[1]</a> but there's no indication that he is Catholic. Regardless of the specifics, he sure seems to pray a lot. He prays before shows,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://blogs.mcall.com/lehighvalleymusic/2012/02/a-day-in-the-life-of-tween-idol-cody-simpson.html" title="Spending a day with &apos;tween idol Cody Simpson.">[2]</a> he prayed for Japan after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://popdirt.com/pop-artists-tweet-well-wishes-to-japan-following-earthquake/81425/" title="Pop Artists Tweet Well Wishes To Japan Following Earthquake.">[3]</a> and even wears shirts imploring others to "Pray for Snow."<a class="source-citation" href="#http://coolspotters.com/musicians/cody-simpson/and/clothing/aviator-nation-pray-for-snow-crew-sweatshirt/media/2418824?utm_campaign=Twitter&utm_source=cody-simpson_aviator-nation-&utm_medium=coo.ly#medium-2418824" title="Cody Simpson and Aviator Nation Pray For Snow Crew Sweatshirt.">[4]</a>

So, it's fairly obvious that Simpson is devout, but to what remains a mystery. One would assume it's to a Christian God he prays, but until he gets a little older and starts answering some hard questions about spirituality and life, it'll remain a mystery.

The fifteen-year-old also doesn't have a lot to say about politics, but he gets a little giddy talking about meeting President Obama.

>We got to meet the President and so that was pretty much the highlight of the tour right now… It was like the first time I had been truly like starstruck by meeting someone…
I met his daughters and all that kind of stuff. They wanted
like t-shirts of me. And I'm like, wow.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.popscreen.com/v/6yvCE/Cody-Simpson-Talks-About-Meeting-President-Obamas-Daughters" title="Cody Simpson Talks About Meeting President Obama&apos;s Daughters.">[5]</a>

As a barely-pubescent teen, it's probably fair to say that Cody Simpson hasn't quite defined himself politically yet. He's obviously an Obama fan, but that definitely doesn't necessarily mean that he has a lot of opinions on his policies, or anyone's policies for that matter. He's just floating along on the teen stardom cloud for now.
