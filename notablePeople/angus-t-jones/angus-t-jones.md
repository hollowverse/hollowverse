Angus T. Jones was born in Austin, Texas and grew up there and in Los Angeles, California.

Most who are familiar with Jones probably know about his faith. It made headlines and nearly cost him his rather high-paying job as star of the popular sitcom, Two and a Half Men.

The show is certainly a perfect example of base humor, full of racy jokes and sexual innuendo. At some point, Jones had a crisis of faith and felt overwhelmingly guilty about his role in spreading what he called "filth."<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/angus-t-jones-of-two-and-a-half-men-finds-christ-slams-show-video-85603/" title="Angus T. Jones of &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos; Finds Christ, Slams Show">[1]</a> He said:

>I just had this big wake-up callâ€¦ I felt God was speaking to me. There were so many other things I could have steered off into that could have made me just another statistic.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2012/november-web-only/i-am-paid-hypocrite-two-and-half-men-star-talks-to-ct-about.html" title="How &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos; Star Became a &apos;Paid Hypocrite.&apos;">[2]</a>

This set off a spiritual quest of sorts for Jones, who eventually settled on becoming a Seventh Day Adventist.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/angus-t-jones-of-two-and-a-half-men-finds-christ-slams-show-video-85603/" title="Angus T. Jones of &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos; Finds Christ, Slams Show">[3]</a> Shortly after, he made a well-produced [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aYKaYZzRDg8) with a controversial Seventh Day Adventist pastor in which he actually asked people to not watch his show:

>If you watch 'Two and a Half Men,' please stop watching 'Two and a Half Men.' I'm on 'Two and a Half Men,' and I don't want to be on it. Please stop watching it, please stop filling your head with filth.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/angus-t-jones-of-two-and-a-half-men-finds-christ-slams-show-video-85603/" title="Angus T. Jones of &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos; Finds Christ, Slams Show">[4]</a>

Industry insiders reported that Young was pulled from the show,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/29/angus-t-jones-two-and-a-half-men-likely-leaving_n_2210801.html" title="Angus T. Jones Of &apos;Two And A Half Men&apos; Will &apos;Likely&apos; Be Leaving After Current Season">[5]</a> but lo and behold, it looks like he'll be back for the 2013 season after all.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv-movies/angus-t-jones-welcomed-back-men-article-1.1238841" title="Angus T. Jones will be welcomed back to &apos;Two and a Half Men&apos; despite trashing the show, CBS Entertainment President Nina Tassler says">[6]</a>

Perhaps the allure of money was just too much for this devout young man. (I might even suspend my ideals for $350,000 per episode.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.christianpost.com/news/stephen-baldwin-believes-angus-t-jones-in-true-walk-with-christianity-85881/" title="Stephen Baldwin Believes Angus T. Jones in &apos;True Walk With Christianity&apos;">[7]</a> )


## Careful who you run with

Jones himself doesn't seem too political. No mention of Obama or gay marriage or any of that hot-button stuff. Even his [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/AngusTJones) conveniently skips over most of election season 2012.

But it's the people Jones associates with who seem to be most interesting politically. Remember the controversial pastor mentioned above? His name is Christopher Hudson and he's got a few things to say, among them: Obama is tantamount to Hitler and Jay-Z and the Devil are good buddies.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2238968/Angus-T-Jones-Jay-Z-devil-worshiping-Freemason-Obama-like-Hitler.html" title="&apos;Jay-Z is a devil-worshiping Freemason and Obama is like Hitler&apos;: Bizarre beliefs of spiritual guide to Two and A Half Men star who branded show &apos;FILTH&apos; . . . as it&apos;s revealed he WON&apos;T be sacked">[8]</a>

Well, it's not Jones himself saying these things, so we'll leave it at that. Perhaps someday, Christopher Hudson will have his own little corner in the Hollowverse. But let it be a lesson: be careful who you make ranting, religious YouTube videos with.
