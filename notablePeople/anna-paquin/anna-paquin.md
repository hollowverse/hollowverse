Anna Paquin was born in Winnipeg, Canada and grew up in Wellington, New Zealand.

There is absolutely no information on Paquin's religion. Even the celebrity religion site, Adherents, is stumped.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.adherents.com/movies/Oscar_actors.html" title="Religion of Best Actor/Best Actress Academy Award Winners">[1]</a> Some speculate that she's Jewish,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_Anna_paquin%27s_religion" title="What is Anna Paquin&apos;s Religion">[2]</a> but there's no evidence of that and it might only be because of her role as the protagonist in the film,The Corageous Heart of Irena Sendler, about a woman who saved thousands of Jewish lives during World War II.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jewishjournal.com/yom_hashoah/article/a_righteous_role_20090416" title="A Righteous Role">[3]</a>

By that logic, we could say that Paquin is some sort of occultist because of her roll in the vampire series, True Blood. But she's not:

>I'm drawn to doing interesting stuff at work. And some of the time with the supernatural, you get to do really crazy, fun things. But I'm not a big genre-fantasy gal, particularly.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/a/anna_paquin.html" title="Anna Paquin Quotes">[4]</a>

Well, let us know in the comments if you know anything.


## Politics of Vampire Descrimination

Paquin is also somewhat vague regarding her political views–though we do have a bit more to go on. As a citizen of New Zealand and Canada, she's correct to assume that her views of U.S. politics are only of value because of her celebrity status:

>I'm not very political. I'm also not American and I don't get to vote so my feelings are not really relevant.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001593/bio" title="Anna Paquin – Biography">[5]</a>

But don't believe she's not at least a little bit political. Her main focus seems to be gay rights. In a PSA for the True Colors Fund, Cindi Lauper's gay rights advocacy group, Paquin said:

>I'm Anna Paquin. I'm bisexual and I give a damn.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20356805,00.html" title="Anna Paquin Comes Out as Bisexual">[6]</a>

She's also spoken about the parallels of True Blood and the gay rights movement. In the series, vampires wish to join mainstream society, with full rights (marriage included).<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.jewishjournal.com/yom_hashoah/article/a_righteous_role_20090416" title="A Righteous Role">[7]</a>

Ultimately Paquin seems like a regular girl who cares most about her work and her family and doesn't stress too much about religion and politics.
