Emily Osment was born and raised in Los Angeles, California.

At least two sources corroborate that Osment was raised a Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://emilyosmentiscool.wordpress.com/all-about-emily-osmentand-more-stuff/" title="All About Emily Osment… and More Stuff!">[1]</a> but she hasn't said anything about Catholicism specifically that I can find.

However, without explaining why, Osment has expressed how important it is to have faith–in something, anything! She said:

>Faith is… very important whether it be any religion or any type of embodiment that you believe in. I feel like just having faith in anything is important, having something to hold on to.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmwGNfdQcDA" title="Faith – Play On Words with Emily Osment">[2]</a>

What if you have faith in burritos? Is that important?

Some of Osment's music, particularly songs like "Gotta Believe in Something," validate this view, as she sings, you… gotta believe in something.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.metrolyrics.com/gotta-believe-in-something-lyrics-emily-osment.html" title="Emily Osment – Gotta Believe in Something Lyrics">[3]</a>

As interesting as this might be, it doesn't illuminate much about Osment's beliefs–other than that she is certainly not a nihilist. Let us know in the comments if you know anything.


## Twitter politics

Osment's political views are vague and everything we might be able to deduce comes from her Twitter feed. Even so, all it indicates is that Osment is aware of the political climate and it doesn't necessarily betray any sort of ideology. That being said, I think she's an Obama supporter. When he won reelection in 2012, Osment, who must have been at acting class at the time, tweeted:

>Scene. OBAMA. Scene. OBAMA. Scene. WINE!!! PARTYYYYY OBAMA. Scene. #actingclass<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/EmilyOsment" title="Emily Osment (EmilyOsment) on Twitter.">[4]</a>

She did retweet an Obama message encouraging people to get registered to vote as well.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://tweetwood.com/conversation/EmilyOsment/BarackObama" title="Twitter conversation between Emily Osment and Barack Obama">[5]</a> On the other hand, Osment felt a bit slighted when Obama didn't return her greeting–and expressed reservations about him:

>Obama didn't wave back at me through the TV….I don't know about this guy….<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/EmilyOsment/status/243918481857343488" title="EmilyOsment: Obama didn&apos;t wave back at me…">[6]</a>

Maybe it's all a big joke to Osment…
