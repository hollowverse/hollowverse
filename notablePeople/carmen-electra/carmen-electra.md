Carmen Electra, whose real name is Tara Leigh Patrick, was born and raised in Sharonville, Ohio.

Electra appears to be a Christian, even though she doesn't talk about it a whole lot. But when her mother and sister both died, and she went through a divorce, all within about a year, it was her faith in God that helped pull her through:

>My relationship with God is one-on-one. My faith has affected my life tremendously, especially in this last year. . . . Instead of going out to a party to take the pain away, I'd spend time alone. I still pray to God every night.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0057950/" title="Carmen Electra Turns To God In Times Of Trouble.">[1]</a>

Aside from that, Electra isn't very chatty about her faith. She seems to be quietly Christian.


## The politics of the non-political

Electra doesn't choose to enter into the political debate, but it's reasonable to think she follows the liberal path tread by other Hollywood celebrities. She's likely a supporter of gay marriage, since she was rumored to have a sexual relationship with openly gay musician Joan Jett, but she's never said as much in public. (Electra claimed they were just friends,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/03/26/carmen_electra_laughs_at_joan_jett_rumor" title="Carmen Electra Laughs At Joan Jett Rumors.">[2]</a> but Jett didn't deny that they were something more.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.afterellen.com/people/2007/3/joanjett" title="A Quickie with Joan Jett.">[3]</a> )

She's also into environmental causes. In 2011 she partnered with Norelco, a company that makes shaving razors, and the Arbor Day Foundation to bring awareness to global deforestation and encourage tree-planting. She spent a few hours "deforesting" or shaving men in New York City to promote the campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://sociallysuperlative.com/2010/04/28/philips-norelco-carmen-electra-shaves-men-in-madison-square-park/" title="Philips Norelco: Carmen Electra Shaves Men in Madison Square Park!">[4]</a>

But that's really all we have to go on for Electra's political beliefs. Even if she leans liberal, there's a good chance that she's not going to show up at the polls on election day to mark her opinion. She does lend her support to several non-political charitable causes, however.

She put together an organization that provides survivors of brain tumors (the disease from which her mother died) with a trip to Hollywood.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/carmen-electra" title="Carmen Electra&apos;s Charity Work, Events, and Causes.">[5]</a> She's also a supporter several organizations that focus on chronic illnesses like cancer, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/carmen-electra" title="Carmen Electra&apos;s Charity Work, Events, and Causes.">[6]</a>
