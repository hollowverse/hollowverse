Ne-Yo, whose real name is Shaffer Chimere Smith, was born in Camden, Arkansas. He grew up there and in Las Vegas, Nevada.

The consensus among Question-Answer sites is that Ne-Yo was born Muslim, but then converted to Christianity during childhood along with his family.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_is_ne-yo" title="What is ne-yo&apos;s religion.">[1]</a> But I could find no information supporting that claim.

He has spoken about how Islam is a peaceful religion,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qme8ZzKVGec" title="NE-YO says Islam is a religion of peace and love.(HARUNYAHYA).">[2]</a> but he is definitely a Christian. When asked about his spirituality he said,

>I pray every day. Not a day goes by that I don't. . . thank God for everything He's done for me. Because I know that without Him none of this is possible. . . . He's the creator of all things. Without God there is nothing.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JdUVrM7zTc&feature=related" title="Ne-Yo – Spiritual Side of Hollywood.">[3]</a>

He's also been known to casually reference God in interviews<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/03/20/music-neyo-dc-idUSN1818498320070320" title="R&amp;B singer Ne-Yo gets the last laugh.">[4]</a> and wear a crucifix.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://lovelyti.com/ne-yo-regrets-giving-irreplaceable-to-beyonce/" title="Ne-yo regrets giving Irreplaceable to Beyonce.">[5]</a> So regardless of his past, Christianity and religious tolerance are both very important to this songwriter.


## Obama All The Way

I couldn't find much information about Ne-Yo's political beliefs aside from his enthusiastic support of Barack Obama. During the president's re-election campaign in 2012, Ne-Yo recorded a song in support of Obama with other high-profile musicians including Johnny Rzeznik and Herbie Hancock.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2012/10/26/ne-yo-obama-song/1661139/" title="Ne-Yo and other artists lend voices to pro-Obama song.">[6]</a>

For Ne-Yo, the election was too important not to get involved. He said,

>I'm not gonna sit and complain with my friends about what's wrong. I'm gonna get out and make sure that I do something to help fix whatever the hell is wrong. You can't complain if you're not gonna do anything about it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ne-yo-wants-to-make-music-and-more-with-nicki-minaj-20120906" title="Ne-Yo on Nicki Minaj: &apos;We Don&apos;t Have to Agree on Politics.&apos;">[7]</a>

One gets the impression that this R&B singer's political fire was lit by the nation's first black president, but he's never said as much. Still, Ne-Yo stuck with Obama after many of his 2008 supporters lost their enthusiasm, so regardless of the reason why, he's a dedicated fan.
