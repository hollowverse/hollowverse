Drew Barrymore was born and raised in Culver City, California.


## Just be positive, man

She appears to have some Christian influence in her life considering the big cross she has tattooed on her leg and two more tattoos of cherubs.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.westlord.com/drew-barrymore-tattoos/" title="Drew Barrymore Tattoos.">[1]</a> But she doesn't talk about her spirituality in terms of Christianity. It's more of a vague, energy-based hippie situation. For her, it's all about being positive.

>I believe that we are all fields of energy and you have the choice whether to be a positive or negative field of energy. I know that sounds hippie-ish but it's what I believe fundamentally. So you could be a bag of toxicity, or you could be a happy, good person that spreads joy. I believe in spreading joy.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20256713,00.html" title="Drew Barrymore Answers Your Questions!">[2]</a>

After she took a trip to India, she got even more in touch with her spiritual side and started meditating daily. She even took to writing "breathe" on her arm to remember to keep her busy Hollywood life in perspective.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.aceshowbiz.com/news/view/w0005811.html" title="Drew Barrymore Embracing Spirituality After Life-Changing Solo Trip to India.">[3]</a>

But rumor has it she could be converting to Judaism–or already has.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.azcentral.com/ent/celeb/articles/2012/03/08/20120308drew-barrymore-reportedly-converting-judaism.html" title="Drew Barrymore reportedly converting to Judaism.">[4]</a> Barrymore got married in 2012 to Will Kopelman in a Jewish ceremony.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20599594,00.html" title="Drew Barrymore Married to Will Kopelman; Wedding in Montecito, Calif.">[5]</a> And now that she is pregnant, if the couple wants their baby to be Jewish, mama Barrymore is going to have to convert.

## The Best Place to Start

Drew Barrymore is committed to getting out the vote, no matter who you're voting for. She made her debut as a director with The Best Place to Start, a documentary about how the youth vote could impact the 2004 presidential election.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.drewbarrymore.com/philanthropy-bps.html" title="The Best Place to Start.">[6]</a> And she has continued to promote it every four years during each presidential race since.<a class="source-citation" href="http://thehill.com/capital-living/in-the-know/207527-voting-advocate-drew-barrymore-im-like-the-worst-at-standing-on-any-political-soapbox" title="Voting advocate Drew Barrymore: &apos;I&apos;m, like, the worst at standing on any political soapbox.&apos;">[7]</a>

>I'm, like, the worst at standing on any political soapbox, but the one thing I've fallen on the sword for is voting.<a class="source-citation" href="http://thehill.com/capital-living/in-the-know/207527-voting-advocate-drew-barrymore-im-like-the-worst-at-standing-on-any-political-soapbox" title="Voting advocate Drew Barrymore: &apos;I&apos;m, like, the worst at standing on any political soapbox.&apos;">[8]</a>

Barrymore might think she's no good at the political soapbox, but she'll still stand on it. Like many of her compadres in Hollywood, Barrymore is a tried and true Democrat. She doesn't just support Obama, she gets emotional.

>When I heard him speak about a gay person never having to sit outside the hospital room with their loved one sick inside, I burst into tears because so many people I care about are homosexual and it was profound to have someone be sensitive to that. That's the kind of world I want to live in, where we're not holding our own principles in judgment above someone or against someone.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/06/drew-barrymore-obama-made_n_132331.html" title="Drew Barrymore: Obama Made Me Cry.">[9]</a>

Barrymore is obviously seriously committed to gay rights. She attended protest rallies against Prop 8, a California ballot measure that made gay marriage illegal.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.justjared.com/2009/05/27/drew-barrymore-gay-marriage-rally/" title="Drew Barrymore Attends Gay Marriage Rally.">[10]</a>

Among many other causes she supports,<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/57-drew-barrymore" title="Drew Barrymore.">[11]</a> she is a big advocate for animal rights, once refusing to wear fur on a cover shoot with Vogue magazine.<a class="source-citation" href="http://www.imdb.com/news/ni0052389/" title="Vogue Forced To Bow Down Over Drew&apos;s Anti-Fur Stance.">[12]</a> She's received a lot of heat recently from her former PETA-loving fans for now eating meat and sometimes wearing leather.<a class="source-citation" href="http://animalrights.net/2002/drew-barrymore-being-a-vegetarian-was-just-sooooo-boring/" title="Drew Barrymore: Being a Vegetarian Was Just Sooooo Boring!">[13]</a> Not that it's unusual for PETA to be outraged.

Drew Barrymore's religious and political beliefs both seem to revolve around one theme: a big heart. She's got a lot of love to give–especially to Obama, gay people, and animals.
