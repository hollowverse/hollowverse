Sigourney Weaver, whose first name at birth was Susan, was born and raised in New York City.

Weaver says she's not all that into organized religion, despite considering a conversion to Judaism for a while. After volunteering on a kibbutz in Israel after high school, she said the conservative culture turned her off.Â (([Sigourney Weaver is "Incensed by Sarah Palin."](http://www.justjared.com/2008/10/10/sigourney-weaver-sarah-palin/) Just Jared.))

With that said, her Scottish<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.contactmusic.com/news/weavers-scottish-ancestry-mix-up_1075133" title="Weaver&apos;s Scottish Ancestry Mix-up.">[1]</a> and English<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.dailymail.co.uk/home/moslive/article-1322176/Sigourney-Weaver-I-love-half-English-England-means-great-courage-great-standards-great-wit.html" title="Sigourney Weaver: &apos;I love being half English. England means great courage, great standards and great wit.&apos;">[2]</a> ancestry implies some sort of Protestant background somewhere down the line.

But, when it all comes down to it, Weaver remains in the non-religious pile. Politics on the hand, is an entirely different story.


## Leave It to the Women

Sigourney Weaver is an active and passionate Democrat. She has been donating to Democratic candidates and organizations since 1991,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Sigourney_Weaver.php" title="Sigourney Weaver&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[3]</a> and she supported Barack Obama wholeheartedly in his first and second presidential elections.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://current.com/shows/full-court-press/videos/sigourney-weaver-on-supporting-president-obama-for-re-election/" title="Sigourney Weaver on supporting President Obama for re-election.">[4]</a>

During the Obamney election cycle in 2012, she said she has always thrown her support behind the Democrats because they are the party of the people. She said,

>The Democrats are always going to be about what the people need. And the Republicans are much more serving big business, and I don't think we can afford to serve big business for another four years with Mr. Romney.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://newsbusters.org/blogs/kyle-drennen/2012/07/16/sigourney-weaver-nbcs-gregory-dems-about-people-gop-just-serving-big-b" title="Sigourney Weaver: Dems About &apos;The People&apos;; GOP Just &apos;Serving Big Business.&apos;">[5]</a>

But that doesn't mean that Obama is beyond her criticism. In her role as an environmentalist, she spoke out against the Obama administration's off-shore drilling plan only months before the Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://cnsnews.com/news/article/actress-sigourney-weaver-criticizes-president-obama" title="Actress Sigourney Weaver Criticizes President Obama.">[6]</a> Her other environmental work includes protesting a dam-building project on the Brazilian Amazon<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.thedailygreen.com/environmental-news/latest/rachel-carson-awards-2011" title="2011 Rachel Carson Award Winners.">[7]</a> and advocating for the world's oceans in front of the United Nations General Assembly,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.commondreams.org/headlines06/1004-05.htm" title="UN to Consider Deep Sea Trawling Ban.">[8]</a> among other things.

Despite being involved and active in her country's politics, Weaver said she wouldn't run for political office herself,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://current.com/shows/full-court-press/videos/sigourney-weaver-on-supporting-president-obama-for-re-election/" title="Sigourney Weaver on supporting President Obama for re-election.">[9]</a> but she does believe more women on the political field would improve the current situation. She said,

>Women speak right out. From the heart, not a prompter. We're not in this for ego or power. We can work together. Ask questions nobody asks. Roll up our sleeves, don't intimidate, get things done in a different way. . . . Business as usual isn't working. A female's needed to stir things up, get our country moving again. This stalemate in Washington can be broken by a woman.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/24/sigourney-weaver-talks-women-in-politics-political-animals_n_1698930.html" title="Sigourney Weaver Talks Women In Politics And &apos;Political Animals.&apos;">[10]</a>

Maybe so. Well, if Hillary Clinton is up for the task in 2016, we know she'll have Weaver's support.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://current.com/shows/full-court-press/videos/sigourney-weaver-on-supporting-president-obama-for-re-election/" title="Sigourney Weaver on supporting President Obama for re-election.">[11]</a>
