Candice Swanepoel was born and raised in Mooi River, South Africa.

Swanepoel doesn't mention religion in interviews or on her [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/angelcandice). She doesn't wear a cross, go to church, or pray either, as far as I can tell.

Considering that the vast majority of South Africans are Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Religion_in_South_Africa" title="Religion in South Africa.">[1]</a> she was probably either raised vaguely Christian or exposed to that religion while she was growing up. And the fact that she sent out a Merry Christmas tweet would back that up–even if it was two days late.<a class="source-citation" href="#https://twitter.com/angelcandice/status/284388235256410114" title="angelcandice: Hope everyone had a very merry …">[2]</a>

But that's all we've got. So despite any murky ties to Christianity, I'm going to call this model non-religious until further notice.

And she's just as silent on politics as she is on religion. She doesn't say a thing.

As often happens to models, she's been criticized for being too thin,<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/31/candice-swanepoel-skinny-victorias-secret_n_843138.html#slide=more18888" title="Candice Swanepoel &apos;Scary Skinny&apos; At Victoria&apos;s Secret Swim Event.">[3]</a> which can have implications for the politics of body image and how women are represented in the media. Her response was to say:

>I am healthy and happy. I'm heartened to know how much everyone cares about me, but in this case, everything is normal and good.<a class="source-citation" href="#http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20478391,00.html" title="Candice Swanepoel: Victoria&apos;s Secret Model Says She&apos;s Healthy.">[4]</a>

That's hardly engaging in the debate about body image and appropriate role models. So we'll call her non-political too. If you have any information I missed, let us know in the comments.
