Emmanuelle "Emmy" Rossum was born and raised in New York City.

Rossum is Jewish. More specifically, her mother is Jewish and her father was Protestant, though she was raised only by her mother.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interfaithfamily.com%2Farts_and_entertainment%2Fpopular_culture%2FInterfaith_Celebrities_Take_Me_Out_to_the_Ballpark_with_Emmy_Rossum.shtml" title="Interfaith Celebrities: Take Me Out to the Ballpark with Emmy Ro.">[1]</a> She said she was exposed to other religions growing up, specifically through her babysitters:

>I always had babysitters and all of them were Irish Catholic. I loved sweets and my babysitters would always bribe me with treats if I would go to Mass with them. So almost every day I would wind up in Catholic Church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interfaithfamily.com%2Farts_and_entertainment%2Fpopular_culture%2FInterfaith_Celebrities_Take_Me_Out_to_the_Ballpark_with_Emmy_Rossum.shtml" title="Interfaith Celebrities: Take Me Out to the Ballpark with Emmy Ro.">[2]</a>

It's tough to say if she's still a practicing Jew, although she does appear to celebrate Hanukkah, make latkes,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shalomlife.com%2Fculture%2F16406%2Ftweets-of-the-week-chanukah-edition%2F" title="Tweets of the Week: Chanukah Edition.">[3]</a> and date Jewish men.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fmoejackson.com%2F2007%2F05%2F30%2F2007-05-30-emmy-russum-likes-them-nerdy-rich-jewish-yummy%2F" title="Emmy Rossum Likes Them Nerdy, Rich &amp; Jewish! Yumm!">[4]</a> But then, she also appears to celebrate Christmas.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Femmyrossum%2Fstatus%2F276921335605768192" title="emmyrossum: Gettin in the holiday spirit …">[5]</a> I know, I know. Lots of practicing Jews celebrate Christmas. I'm just throwing that out there. Geez.

In the end, Jewish yes. Practicing maybe. Any more info? Let us know in the comments.


## Shamelessly Liberal

Emmy Rossum is liberal through and through. Even though she doesn't have any campaign contributions to speak of, she announced her support for Obama in 2012 on Twitter.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Ftweetwood.com%2Femmyrossum%2Ftweet%2F203178634540879873" title="Emmy Rossum tweets.">[6]</a> And she was on the front lines of the fight for marriage equality when she attended an anti-Prop 8 rally in Los Angeles.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.contactmusic.com%2Fphoto%2Femmy_rossum_5302017" title="Emmy Rossum took to the streets of Los Angeles to march…">[7]</a>

Rossum also described herself as a pacifist<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cinemablend.com%2Fnew%2FEmmy-Rossum-Explains-Dragonball-Involvement-7321.html" title="Emmy Rossum Explains Dragonball Involvement.">[8]</a> and is somewhat of an environmentalist. About her movie The Day After Tomorrow, which depicts a world in which severe global warming has caused an ice age, she said:

>The environment is really important to me. One of the reasons I'm glad I did ,The Day After Tomorrow, is because it opened a dialogue about the effects of global warming.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.emmyweb.net%2Fexclusiveinterview_mel2.php" title="Exclusive Interview.">[9]</a>

She wore an eco-friendly dress made out of hemp and pineapple fibers to a pre-Oscar party in 2012,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.stylebistro.com%2FFashion%2BForum%2Farticles%2Fxubk8kwJ2TH%2FEmmy%2BRossum%2BEco%2BFriendly%2BDress%2B2012%2BPre%2BOscar" title="Emmy Rossum&apos;s Eco Friendly Dress At 2012 Pre-Oscar Party.">[10]</a> she said she tries to do her part for the environment by recycling and driving a hybrid,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mnn.com%2Flifestyle%2Farts-culture%2Fstories%2Femmy-rossum-eco-conscious-and-shameless" title="Emmy Rossum: Eco-conscious and &apos;Shameless.&apos;">[11]</a> and she works with several non-profit organizations to promote awareness of environmental issues.

Well folks, we've got another Hollywood liberal on our hands. But we can never have too many, right? Right?
