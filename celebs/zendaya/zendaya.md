Zendaya, whose last name is Coleman, was born in Oakland, California. She grew up there and in Los Angeles, California.

All we have to go on with Zendaya's religion is speculation. Neither her MySpace page nor Facebook page list a religion so I think it's safe to assume she isn't very religious. Fans speculate that she is Christian,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhere_does_Zendaya_Colman_go_to_church" title="Where does Zendaya Coleman go to church.">[1]</a> and possibly Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhat_religion_is_zendaya_Coleman" title="What religion is zendaya Coleman.">[2]</a> but again, no proof of that.


## Young Liberal

As far as politics goes, not a lot on that either. She performed at the White House Easter Egg Roll in 2012,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fgovne.ws%2Fitem%2F2012-White-House-Easter-Egg-Roll-Zendaya-Performs%23" title="2012 White House Easter Egg Roll: Zendaya Performs.">[3]</a> but that in itself is obviously not a show of support for President Obama. Zendaya has a white mother and a black father,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneydreaming.com%2F2012%2F06%2F20%2Fhappy-anniversary-to-zendaya-colemans-parents-june-20-2012%2F" title="Happy Anniversary To Zendaya Coleman&apos;s Parents June 20, 2012.">[4]</a> however, so no matter what she thinks about his politics, she at least has something in common with the President.

Zendaya is a vegetarian, and is a PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals) supporter. She partnered with the company Millions of Milkshakes to donate $1 of every one of her signature milkshakes sold to the animal rights organization.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta2.com%2Fblog%2Fshake-it-up-star-zendaya-coleman-gives-back-to-peta2%2F" title="&apos;Shake It Up&apos; star Zendaya Coleman gives back to peta2!">[5]</a>

Because of her eating habits and support of PETA, I think we can call her liberal. And if she keeps on in Hollywood, chances are she'll stay liberal.
