Miranda Cosgrove was born in Los Angeles, California.

There is no indication of her religion, which is particularly strange for an American child star, except for her Myspace page, where she lists herself as "Christian-other."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Fmirandacosgrove14" title="Miranda Cosgrove on Myspace">[1]</a> I get the Christian part, but what is this other business?


## Political guest star

Cosgrove hasn't come out about her political leanings either. But she did share a stage once with Michelle Obama, if that counts for anything.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F01%2F11%2Fmichelle-obama-icarly-miranda-cosgrove-nathan-kress_n_1198394.html" title="Michelle Obama On &apos;iCarly&apos;: Miranda Cosgrove, Nathan Kress Share First Lady Stories">[2]</a> In an interview after their meeting, Cosgrove only had nice things to say.

Truly, she's young and a rising star in Hollywood. She's probably hanging out with liberals and Democrats all day long, so it's likely that has or will rub off on Cosgrove.
