President George W. Bush was born in New Haven, Connecticut. He is the son of another former president, George Bush, Sr.

Bush was raised in a protestant home that ping-ponged between being Presbyterian and Episcopalian. However, in 1985, Bush had a change of heart. He quit drinking alcohol and, because of the inspiration of evangelical Billy Graham, "found God" and joined the United Methodist Church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.adherents.com%2Fpeople%2Fpb%2FGeorge_W_Bush.html" title="Religion of George W. Bush, U.S. President">[1]</a>

Bush has spoken about the influence of his faith on the decisions he made as president, saying:

>My faith plays a big part in my life. And when I was answering that question what I was really saying to the person was that I pray a lot. And I do. And my faith is a very, it's very personal. I pray for strength. I pray for wisdom. I pray for our troops in harm's way. I pray for my family. I pray for my little girls.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.beliefnet.com%2FNews%2FPolitics%2F2004%2F07%2FGeorge-W-Bush-On-Faith.aspx" title="George W. Bush On Faith">[2]</a>

You can just imagine America's atheists thinking: 'Maybe asking your imaginary friend what you should do as leader of the world's most powerful country isn't such a good idea.' But hey, everything worked out just fine, didn't it?


## Politics of a president

Looking back at the Bush administration, it kind of seems like he was just a regular Republican conservative that was just winging it as he went along. In his defense, he had a lot of major challenges during his term, from 9/11 to Hurricane Katrina. And it is easy to look backwards and say what someone should or should not have done.

But certainly the running theme is: "That was a bad idea."

His reaction to 9/11 was to go to war with countries that had little or nothing to do with that event. Katrina was a botched job, and Bush even admitted it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nola.com%2Fnews%2Findex.ssf%2F2009%2F01%2Fbush_concedes_mistakes_during.html" title="President Bush concedes mistakes during Katrina, but says fed action not slow">[3]</a>

During his term, there was regular imprisonment and torture of foreign nationals with little or no evidence against them.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2011%2Fjul%2F12%2Fgeorge-w-bush-torture" title="George W Bush should be prosecuted over torture, says human rights group">[4]</a> In fact, Bush had to cancel a trip to Switzerland because there was worry that Swiss authorities were going to have him arrested and tried for war crimes having to do with international agreements on torture.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FPolitics%2Fgeorge-bush-cancels-swiss-trip-rights-activists-vow%2Fstory%3Fid%3D12857195" title="George W. Bush Cancels Swiss Trip as Rights Activists Vow War Crimes Charges">[5]</a>

There was, of course, the PATRIOT Act,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FPatriot_Act" title="Patriot Act">[6]</a> Abu Ghraib,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mcclatchydc.com%2F2008%2F06%2F18%2F41514%2Fgeneral-who-probed-abu-ghraib.html" title="General who probed Abu Ghraib says Bush officials committed war crimes">[7]</a> and clear connections to oil companies and giant corporations that made millions upon millions of dollars with contracts with the federal government.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbringiton22205.tripod.com%2Fid6.html" title="Bush, Cheney, and Halliburton">[8]</a>

Unfortunately, the list goes on from poor economic policy to hindering life-saving advances in science.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fstemcells.nih.gov%2Fpolicy%2F2001policy.htm" title="Human Embryonic Stem Cell Policy Under Former President Bush">[9]</a>Â Most Americans with a rational bone in their body would prefer to pretend that the Bush administration never happened. But what does Bush have to say about it?

>I'd do it again to save lives.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mlive.com%2Fnews%2Fgrand-rapids%2Findex.ssf%2F2010%2F06%2Fid_do_it_again_former_presiden.html" title="&apos;I&apos;d do it again&apos; former President Bush tells Grand Rapids crowd about waterboarding terrorists">[10]</a>

Well, that's nice.
