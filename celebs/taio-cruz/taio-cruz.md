Jacob Taio Cruz, known professionally as Taio Cruz, was born and raised in London, England.

Information about Cruz' religious beliefs are pretty slim, but we'll do our best here. He went to a boarding school in his youth that is associated with the Church of England.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-1229384%2FForget-bling-boarding-school-boy-Taio-Cruz-R-B-star-difference-No-wonder-Cheryl-Simon-love-him.html" title="Forget bling, boarding school boy Taio Cruz is the R&amp;B star with a difference. No wonder Cheryl and Simon love him.">[1]</a> So one would assume that he was at least exposed to Protestantism in his childhood.

But if he was at one point thinking about Christianity, he doesn't appear to be thinking about it nowâ€“or any religion for that matter. Maybe nobody asks, or maybe he doesn't care to answer. Either way, until further we hear otherwise, Taio Cruz is non-religious.

And if you thought we had nothing on his religion, we've really got nothing on his politics. He performed at the London Olympics closing ceremony in 2012,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thehollywoodgossip.com%2F2012%2F08%2Ftaio-cruz-and-friends-help-close-out-london-olympics%2F" title="Taio Cruz and Friends Help Close Out London Olympics.">[2]</a> which is probably one of the least political government gigs possible.

His philanthropic work is focused on children advocacy organizations like Big Brothers, Big Sisters and Help a London Child.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.looktothestars.org%2Fcelebrity%2Ftaio-cruz" title="Taio Cruz&apos;s Charity Work, Events and Causes.">[3]</a> Helping kids is possibly the least political or controversial thing a celebrity could support, so no help there.

And so, as with his non-religious beliefs, Taio Cruz appears to be entirely non-political. If you've got some more insight, let us know in the comments.
