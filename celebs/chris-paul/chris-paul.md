Chris Paul was born and raised in Lewisville, North Carolina.

Paul is a Baptist and grew up attending the Dreamland Park Baptist Church in Lewisville.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fsports.espn.go.com%2Fespn%2Fmagazine%2Farchives%2Fnews%2Fstory%3Fpage%3Dmagazine-20041122-article37" title="Home Cookin&apos; College Hoops 2005">[1]</a>

There's not much straight out of Chris' mouth about his religious views, though he does pray before every game while the Star Spangled Banner is playing,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2005%2F02%2F04%2Fsports%2Fncaabasketball%2F04wake.html" title="Wake Forest&apos;s Paul Puts Maturity First">[2]</a> so we can assume he's still devout in his faith.

His parents, however, are quick to proudly proclaim their sons strong faith in God–and their own. His father, Charles, said:

>My wife and I give all the credit to God because God is the one that gave us Chris and gave us the chance. Like Chris says, he was given an opportunity to play basketball, so we're grateful for how God has blessed us.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.journalnow.com%2Fsports%2Fpro_sports%2Fbasketball%2Fimage_06eeddfc-5d34-5eb2-80c7-ec9005978cd1.html" title="Home is still Lewisville, despite son&apos;s success">[3]</a>

And while Paul was still in college, after his grandfather died, Charles said the experience had only made Chris' faith in God stronger.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2005%2F02%2F04%2Fsports%2Fncaabasketball%2F04wake.html" title="Wake Forest&apos;s Paul Puts Maturity First">[4]</a>

I'd like to hear it from Chris himself. Who knows what he really thinks? It could just be a classic case of deluded parents. Help us out in the comments if you know anything.


## Buddy-buddy politics

Paul probably spends too much time practicing to really get heavy with the press about his views on individual political issues. But he and President Obama seem to have an interesting relationship.

First of all, Paul is a big supporter. He donated $30,000 to the president's 2012 reelection campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.policymic.com%2Farticles%2F4631%2Flebron-james-chris-paul-and-vince-carter-give-30-000-each-to-reelect-barack-obama%26op%3D" title="LeBron James, Chris Paul, and Vince Carter Give $30,000 Each to Reelect Barack Obama">[5]</a> And he serves on Obama's Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjJj2ZqJfQls" title="B.S. Report – President Obama Talks about Crossing over Chris Paul with Bill Simmons">[6]</a> a special council where famous volunteer athletes advise the president (through the Secretary of Health and Human Services) on how he can help provide access to physical activity and nutrition programs for America's youth.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whitehouse.gov%2Fthe-press-office%2Ffirst-lady-launches-president-s-council-fitness-sports-and-nutrition" title="First Lady Launches President&apos;s Council on Fitness, Sports and Nutrition">[7]</a>

In return, Obama talks Paul up during interviews and invites him to the White House to play all-star games with him and saying things like:

>I love Chris Paul. He's a great guy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DjJj2ZqJfQls" title="B.S. Report – President Obama Talks about Crossing over Chris Paul with Bill Simmons">[8]</a>

Paul certainly has friends in high places. Maybe we'll see a political career after he retires from basketball.
