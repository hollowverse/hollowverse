Marc Jacobs was born and raised in New York City.

Jacobs is Jewish,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Freporting%2F2008%2F09%2F01%2F080901fa_fact_levy%3FcurrentPage%3Dall" title="Profiles: Enchanted">[1]</a> but one gets the sense it isn't something that Jacobs takes too seriously. He is largely estranged from his family. His father died when he was very young and his mother, according to Jacobs, is unstable. He said:

>I haven't spoken to her or my sister and brother in years and years. I never feel like it's a bad thing. I mean, my mom's very, very sick—mentally ill. She didn't really take care of her kids.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newyorker.com%2Freporting%2F2008%2F09%2F01%2F080901fa_fact_levy%3FcurrentPage%3Dall" title="Profiles: Enchanted">[2]</a>

It seems that religion and Jacobs are not bedfellows–no mention of God or Israel to be found. If anything, Jacobs' religion is himself:

>I'm really into my life right now. Everything, all aspects of my life. All the drama, the intrigue, the sex, the romance, the work. I'm a shameless human being… The whole thing's sort of egotistical, I suppose. But I do find myself entertaining.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Flifeandstyle%2Flostinshowbiz%2F2007%2Fnov%2F19%2Fmarcjacobsajewwrites" title="Marc Jacobs: a Jew writes">[3]</a>

## An American in Paris

From Jacobs' high-ranking position at Christian Dior in Paris, Jacobs comments on U.S. and world politics through his fashion.

A line of t-shirts Jacobs designed in support of the "Free Tibet" movement didn't go over well in China.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fashionologie.com%2FMarc-Jacobs-Fashion-Politics-24080655" title="Marc Jacobs on Fashion and Politics">[4]</a> And during the 2nd Bush administration, Jacobs sold t-shirts reading "Worst President Ever."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F07%2F20%2Fmarc-jacobs-politics_n_1690121.html" title="Marc Jacobs: I&apos;m Done Talking About Politics">[5]</a> In 2012, Jacobs participated in Obama's "Runway To Win" campaign in which designers sold expensive shirts to support the president's reelection bid.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F01%2F12%2Frunway-to-win_n_1202870.html%23s608745%26title%3DMarc_Jacobs" title="Runway To Win T-Shirts, Totes Debut On Obama Website">[6]</a>

Lastly, Jacobs (who is openly gay<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2127938%2FMarc-Jacobs-new-porn-star-beau-Harry-Louis-enjoy-romantic-day-beach.html" title="Marc Jacobs and new porn star beau Harry Louis enjoy a romantic day at the beach">[7]</a> ) has designed t-shirts to support gay marriage.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.fashionologie.com%2FMarc-Jacobs-Fashion-Politics-24080655" title="Marc Jacobs on Fashion and Politics">[8]</a> It's socially-conscious, fashion-forward chic.

But it was the Free Tibet scandal–widely criticized in China–that ultimately discouraged Jacobs from participating politically. He said:

>I guess politics and fashion, you've always got to be a bit careful because somebody's going to get offended or somebody's going to feel it isn't right. I don't want to sound stupid or ignorant or anything, but… if you want to avoid controversy, you just don't do [political] things like that.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F07%2F20%2Fmarc-jacobs-politics_n_1690121.html" title="Marc Jacobs: I&apos;m Done Talking About Politics">[9]</a>
