Jamie Foxx, whose real name is Eric Bishop, was born and raised in Terrell, Texas.

Foxx was raised Baptist and participated in his church choir during his youth.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eduinreview.com%2Fblog%2F2011%2F04%2Fjamie-foxxs-education-background%2F" title="Jamie Foxx&apos;s Education Background.">[1]</a> Although I couldn't find any serious quotes from him about his current take on spirituality, he appears to still be a Baptist.

He reveals his familiarity with the Baptist church during some of his comedy routines when he makes fun of church choirs and preachers.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpvQ24v4EffY" title="Jaime Foxx Unleashed – Real Church.">[2]</a> And he talked about how God obviously wanted him to procreate by giving him such a monumental sex drive.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DvoZUNoA4ixc" title="Jamie Foxx on &quot;Jesus&quot; (LookLaugh Certified).">[3]</a> There's also some pretty heavy religious content on some of his music.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_LD_7rTOqMU%26feature%3Drelated" title="Hallelujah – The Game Ft. Jamie Foxx.">[4]</a>

But when a reporter asked him what God means to him, he didn't take the opportunity to expound about his faith. Instead he seemed a little annoyed and said, "I don't know, what does it mean to you?" The reporter said, "God is everything" and he responded,

>Then you already got the answer, why are you asking me? . . . God is everything. All right.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DpC4SIlhochU" title="Jamie Foxx Has No Opinion on GOD.">[5]</a>

It's tough to know how exactly to interpret that remark. Maybe they caught him on a bad day. But still, Foxx gives every indication that he continues to be a Baptist, even if he won't really talk about it outside of his professional roles as a comic and rapper. If any of you can find a good quote for us, please let us know in the comments.


## The Best Country

Foxx leaves nothing on the table in regards to his political beliefs: he's a fervent supporter of the Democratic party. He's been donating to that party since 2006, but in 2009 he upped the ante by donating $30,400 to the Democratic National Committee and a few years later another $17,900 to Barack Obama's reelection campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Fcelebrity_political_donations%2FJamie_Foxx.php" title="Jamie Foxx&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[6]</a> That's a pretty heavy chunk of change.

His support for the Democrats seems to stem mainly from his belief that government should be working for the common man–the lower and middle classes. He said,

>No matter how much money I make, it doesn't matter. Every time I drive down the street or into a neighborhood that doesn't have as much, you feel for them. . . . I think what we gotta get away from is, making the person who is the common man feel bad about himself. . . . Everyone matters.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fdimewars.com%2FBlog%2FViewBlogArticle.aspx%3Fvn%3DJamie%2BFoxx%2BReflects%2BOn%2BAmerican%2BPolitics%26BlogID%3D796ba4a7-d86a-4c0c-b866-4c40ed7e7e63" title="Jamie Foxx Reflects On American Politics.">[7]</a>

He heartily supported Obama in both 2008 and 2012, and he recorded several videos encouraging the black community to get out and vote for America's first black president.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thirdbaptist.org%2Fjamie-foxx-introducing-dr-amos-brown-who-informs-us-on-why-we-should-vote%2F" title="Jamie Foxx introducing Dr. Amos Brown, who informs us on why we should vote.">[8]</a> And he even agrees with the Democrats on their position on gay marriage–an issue which he didn't always support. He said his 13-year-old daughter convinced him that whether or not people are gay and want to get married shouldn't be something that he should care to stop.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6UFQruw3zeM" title="Movie Men Ron Howard, Jamie Foxx, Weigh in on Politics, Republican Obstruction.">[9]</a>

But in the end, it's the democratic process and the country of his birth that he loves the most:

>This is the best country to live in. . . . [because of] the freedoms we have here, even the freedom to question [our leaders].<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D6UFQruw3zeM" title="Movie Men Ron Howard, Jamie Foxx, Weigh in on Politics, Republican Obstruction.">[10]</a>
