Christina Ricci was born in Santa Monica, California and grew up mostly in Montclair, New Jersey.

Ricci apparently prefers to keep her religious views to herself for the most part, but she did confess her spiritual leanings in one interview:

>I am a Christian. I haven't really talked about that before. It is something very private. But I do pray and my beliefs are very important to me.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.askmen.com%2Fcelebs%2Fentertainment-news%2Fchristina-ricci%2Fchristina-ricci-desperate-to-marry.html" title="Christina Ricci desperate to marry.">[1]</a>

And she really does seem to pray a lot. She said she used to pray to the Christ-like character Aslan, from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe by C. S. Lewis, so that he would take her away to Narnia.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2011%2F10%2F07%2Fliving%2Fbooks-ricci-o%2Findex.html" title="Christina Ricci&apos;s top reads.">[2]</a> Plus she has two praying hands tattooed on her stomach.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christinaricci.ws%2Fchristina-ricci%2Ftattoos" title="Tattoos.">[3]</a>

I tried and failed to find out for sure which denomination she belongs to, but if I had to guess, I'd say Catholic. Even though she has an Italian surname, she says most of her ancestry is Irish.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20031123103510%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.christinaricci.info%2Fcgi-dodger%2Fshowpage.pl%3Fsel%3Dinterviews%26url%3Diview7.ssf" title="The Minx Effect.">[4]</a> But either way, Italian or Irish, Catholic is a good bet. But then again, some of her political involvement might point in another direction.


## Ricci for Women

Christina Ricci's political focus is directed toward women and children's issues. First of all, she sits on the national board of VOX: Voices for Planned Parenthood, which aims to educate teens and young people about their reproductive health and rights.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000207%2Fbio" title="Christina Ricci (I) – Biography.">[5]</a> She also appeared in a public service announcement for Planned Parenthood about emergency contraception.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F22541596" title="Planned Parenthood &quot;Teardrop&quot; PSA.">[6]</a>

Her main passion, however, is reserved for the charity RAINN (Rape, Abuse, & Incest National Network). In 2009 she traveled to Washington, D.C. to lobby Congress about the issue and to advocate for protection of the Violence Against Women Act.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fcapital-living%2F20-questions%2F58627-20-questions-with-christina-ricci" title="20 Questions with Christina Ricci.">[7]</a>

But in terms of partisan politics, Ricci said that in her role as National Spokesperson for RAINN, she prefers to stay publicly neutral since the issue itself is bipartisan.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fcapital-living%2F20-questions%2F58627-20-questions-with-christina-ricci" title="20 Questions with Christina Ricci.">[8]</a> But when asked who her political heroes were, she mentioned mostly Democrats. She said she loves political commentator and Democrat James Carville, and also:

>Oh, my God, if I met Biden, I would lose my mind. He wrote the Violence Against Women Act, and I love him. I think he's great. And of course, no doubt, I want to meet Obama. But that's not really going to happen.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fthehill.com%2Fcapital-living%2F20-questions%2F58627-20-questions-with-christina-ricci" title="20 Questions with Christina Ricci.">[9]</a>

And her one and only campaign contribution on record is to Democrat John Kerry during his 2004 presidential bid against George W. Bush.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2F68.234.14.2%2Fcelebrity_political_donations%2FChristina_Ricci.php" title="Christina Ricci&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[10]</a> So I think it's safe to call her a Democrat.
