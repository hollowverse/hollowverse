More famous for an assertive booty and occasional nip-slips, Jennifer Lopez is actually active in both politics and religion. Raised Catholic in the Bronx, NY, in a Puerto Rican family, she also followed Santeria,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rickross.com%2Freference%2Fkabbalah%2Fkabbalah44.html" title="The red string squad">[1]</a> which is a combination of Catholicism and West African religions. Her father has been a Scientologist for twenty years, and now she's one, too.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fstory%2F0%2C2933%2C252114%2C00.html" title="Scientologis to Be? Jennifer Lopez and Marc Antony Are Losing Their Religion">[2]</a>

Jennifer Lopez spouts the same blandishments as other "spiritual" stars:

>At the end of the day it's all about being, like, a good person — centered, focused and at peace.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F2001%2F01%2F23%2Farts%2Frevisions-spirituality-infuses-the-mainstream-but-who-is-uplifted.html%3Fpagewanted%3Dall%26src%3Dpm" title="REVISIONS; Spirituality Infuses the Mainstream, but Who is Uplifted?">[3]</a>

When Lopez converted to Scientology, it caused some to speculate that her new religion caused the split between her and Marc Anthony, who was never as keen on the religion as Lopez and was against sending their children to Scientology-based private school.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianpost.com%2Fnews%2Fjennifer-lopez-and-marc-anthony-split-because-of-scientology-53952%2F" title="Jennifer Lopez and Marc Antony Split Because of Scientology?">[4]</a>

## Can't a girl get a break?

She cancelled a show in Cyprus in 2010 for political reasons, according to a statement from her spokesperson:

>Jennifer Lopez would never knowingly support any state, country, institution or regime that was associated with any form of human rights abuse.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hecklerspray.com%2Fjennifer-lopez-gets-political-withdraws-from-northern-cyprus%2F201048090.php" title="Jennifer Lopez Gets Political, Withdraws From Northern Cyprus">[5]</a>

She was given kudos at the time for political awareness, but has more recently come under fire for her FIAT endorsement: they do business with Iran, very anti-human rights.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popularcritic.com%2F2012%2F01%2F23%2Fjennifer-lopez-under-scrutiny-for-fiat-contract%2F" title="Jennifer Lopez Under Scrutiny For Fiat Contract">[6]</a>

Lopez is surely a Democrat. On the George Lopez Show, she called Sarah Palin a "Cabrona" (bitch)<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsroom.mtv.com%2F2010%2F01%2F21%2Fjennifer-lopez-sarah-palin%2F" title="Jennifer Lopez Hijacks &apos;Lopez Tonight,&apos; Takes On Sarah Palin">[7]</a> and in 2011, Lopez watched the Super Bowl with President Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpoliticalticker.blogs.cnn.com%2F2011%2F02%2F03%2Fjennifer-lopez-headed-to-the-whie-house%2F" title="Jennifer Lopez Headed to the White House">[8]</a>
