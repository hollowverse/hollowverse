Bear Grylls was born in Donaghadee, Northern Ireland and grew up in Bembridge on the Isle of Wight off the southern coast of England.

Grylls is a very devout Christian, an Anglican from the Protestant corner of Ireland. He speaks openly of his faith, often giving motivational presentations to rather large crowds.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Djnku92yPvFQ" title="Bear Grylls talks about his faith">[1]</a> He describes his faith as the "backbone" that runs through his many, often dangerous, activities. He said:

>For me, [my faith is] very unreligious, and it's not heavy. It's like finding home.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Djnku92yPvFQ" title="Bear Grylls talks about his faith">[2]</a>

For Grylls, a relationship with God is a very simple thing. He laments that people try to make it too complicated, or become intimidated by theology or ritual. He said:

>…some people are just scared, and they go, 'Oh, God just wants me to be religious,' but actually He just loves us. He just wants us to be with Him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.relevantmagazine.com%2Fculture%2Ftv%2Ffeatures%2F22088-the-wild-faith-of-bear-grylls" title="The Wild Faith of Bear Grylls">[3]</a>

Grylls has been heavily involved with a worldwide organization called Alpha, which hopes to invite people to low-pressure meetings to discuss theological questions in the context of Christianity.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphausa.org%2FGroups%2F1000047505%2FWhat_is_Alpha.aspx" title="What is Alpha">[4]</a> Grylls often promotes and speaks at Alpha events.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alphausa.org%2FGroups%2F1000047564%2FAlpha_and_Bear.aspx" title="Alpha and Bear Grylls">[5]</a> And if you follow him on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/BearGrylls), you'll notice quite a few Bible verses.


## Family politics

Grylls is the son of the late Michael Grylls, a long-serving British Conservative Party member of parliament, who was a champion of right-leaning economics and staunchly loyal to Margaret Thatcher. Toward the end of his career, he was implicated in what would come to be know the "Cash-for-questions" scandal, in which Grylls and his cohorts were accused of skimming money off of payments made by business owners to meet with politicians.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fobituaries%2F1322322%2FSir-Michael-Grylls.html" title="Sir Michael Grylls">[6]</a>

But a man's father's politics are not necessarily his own and Bear Grylls has made a few political statements of his own–perhaps most notably as the Chief Scout for the British Cub Scouts. The organization has taken some flak over not living up to its so-called "inclusive" philosophy and requiring a profession of faith to become a member.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fgodandpoliticsuk.org%2F2012%2F04%2F20%2Fnss-finds-that-scouts-do-keep-their-promises%2F" title="National Secular Society finds that Scouts do keep their promises">[7]</a>

Beyond that, Grylls has championed various environmental causes, from circumnavigating Britain on a jet ski fueled by garbage to owning his own wildlife reserve off the coast of Wales.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cityspeakersinternational.co.uk%2Fbear-grylls" title="Bear Grylls">[8]</a> But even this doesn't come without its critics, with some pointing out that Grylls' stunts and nature shows are all for the profits of large corporations.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thepunch.com.au%2Farticles%2Fbear-grylls-environmental-warrior-or-corporate-sellout%2F" title="Bear Grylls: Environmental warrior or corporate sellout?">[9]</a>

One gets the feeling Grylls doesn't get too deep into the details–whether it's the theology behind his faith or the motivation behind his causes. He once said:

>I never wanted to be very smart or very rich, I just wanted to follow my dreams and have loads of fun.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.relevantmagazine.com%2Fculture%2Ftv%2Ffeatures%2F22088-the-wild-faith-of-bear-grylls" title="The Wild Faith of Bear Grylls">[10]</a>
