Born in Waco, Texas, Jennifer Love Hewitt spent her early childhood in Nolanville, Texas until she moved to Los Angeles, California at the age of ten.

Hewitt shows up on a few lists of famous atheists,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Flist%2FOp3x45Q3_Ww%2F" title="Some Of The Atheist Celebrities!!. IMDb">[1]</a> but the actress hasn't confirmed that. In fact, she seems to be at least mildly religious–although to what is still a mystery.

After her mother died, a representative of the family said,

>She was an angel to all who knew her and they are grateful she is now in a better place.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20603728%2C00.html" title="Jennifer Love Hewitt&apos;s Mother, Patricia Hewitt, Dies.">[2]</a>

And in an interview about her role as the devil in the film Shortcut to Happiness she says,

>We like to walk around and pretend we're not affected by evil and sin, but we're a society that is completely devastated by it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fculture.com%2Farticles%2F566%2Fheartbreakers-interview-with-jennifer-love-hewitt.phtml" title="Heartbreakers: Interview With Jennifer Love Hewitt.">[3]</a>

That sure doesn't sound like atheism, but she could certainly be agnostic. Or a devoted and quiet Christian for that matter. The jury's still out on this one.

Hewitt doesn't appear to affiliate with a political party, and she's mute on political hot-button issues. But she does dabble in philanthropy. It doesn't look like she'll be flying to Ethiopia to build schools any time soon, but she occasionally helps with fundraising efforts for various mainstream causes like breast cancer awareness<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fjewelsforhope.net%2Findex.php%3Froute%3Dproduct%2Fproduct%26product_id%3D119" title="Celebrity – Jennifer Love Hewitt.">[4]</a> and the humane treatment of animals.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.zimbio.com%2Fpictures%2FEL5-rKv8-4Q%2FJennifer%2BLove%2BHewitt%2BActors%2BOthers%2BAnimals" title="Jennifer Love Hewitt at the Actors and Others for Animals Luncheon – Pictures.">[5]</a>

## Hewitt lashes out against objectification

She appears to be most passionate about decrying the objectification of women. Like all Hollywood celebrities, it's hard for Hewitt to get too far away from a camera. So when some unflattering pictures of her popped up on a gossip website under the headline, "We know what you ate this summer, Love—everything!" Hewitt fought back, prompting an apology from the site.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farchive%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20170939%2C00.html" title="Jennifer Love Hewitt Fires Back.">[6]</a> She stated on her website:

>Like all women out there should, I love my body. To all girls with butts, boobs, hips and a waist, put on a bikini—put it on and stay strong.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farchive%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20170939%2C00.html" title="Jennifer Love Hewitt Fires Back.">[7]</a>

It's not that she's always confident about her body and her looks, but she decided that she would rather be a role model than a victim.

>At first I sat down and cried when I saw all the horrible things people were writing about my weight, but then I decided that I had to be stronger. I realized that if people called me fat, then there would be thousands of teenage girls all around America that would feel even worse than I did. Then I decided not to be picked on.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com%2F67569634.html" title="Jennifer Love Hewitt Talks Fashion &amp; Body Image.">[8]</a>

Hewitt, who has gained and lost weight throughout her career, has been the object of gossip column ridicule as long as she's been in the spotlight. Luckily for all the women and girls who look to celebrities as the bellwether of body image, they have Jennifer Love Hewitt as a spokeswoman.
