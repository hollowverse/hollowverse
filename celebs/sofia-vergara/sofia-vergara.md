  religion: "Vergara was brought up in a strict Catholic household, but doesn't practice her childhood faith anymore. Now, she just \"thanks God.\""
  politicalViews: "Vergara doesn't seem to have much in the way of political views, except to say that the road to accepting homosexuals in the largely Catholic Latin American community will be a long one. Her longtime boyfriend, Nick Loeb, however, is a confirmed Republican."

Sofía Vergara, whose full name is Sofía Margarita Vergara Vergara (yes, two of the same last name), was born in Barranquilla, Colombia and moved to the U.S. at the age of 23.

Vergara was raised a devout Catholic. Her parents are still devout to this day. In fact, Vergara's mother convinced her not to get breast reduction surgery, saying that God will punish her if she did.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celebitchy.com%2F111811%2Fsofia_vergara_complains_about_women_getting_freakish_surgeries_like_madonna%2F" title="Sofia Vergara complains about women getting freakish surgeries, &quot;like Madonna.&quot;">[1]</a>

But Vergara isn't much of a Catholic anymore, and she feels that God probably doesn't care too much about her fashion or style choices, saying:

>I don't think God cares if I wear nail polish or not. I don't think that's a deal breaker for him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celebitchy.com%2F111811%2Fsofia_vergara_complains_about_women_getting_freakish_surgeries_like_madonna%2F" title="Sofia Vergara complains about women getting freakish surgeries, &quot;like Madonna.&quot;">[2]</a>

Plus, she was once divorced<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.redbookmag.com%2Ffun-contests%2Fcelebrity%2Fsofia-vergara-interview-2" title="Sofia Vergara Interview – Sofia Vergara Talks Divorce, Her Son, and Surviving Cancer">[3]</a> (a big Catholic no-no) and she has a rather realistic take on homosexuality–something the religious devout can rarely claim. She says:

>The Latin community is a very Catholic community. So, it's always a problem for people to accept it, and they live in denial for many years, the parents, and prefer not to address the problem. And that's when tragedies and things happen. And, you know, it's hard. You're not going to change things in one day.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.datalounge.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fiowa%2Fajax.html%3Ft%3D9720905%23page%3AshowThread%2C9720905" title="Modern Family&apos;s Sofia Vergara on Gay Acceptance in the Latin Community">[4]</a>

Still, Vergara believes in God and says she still thanks Him for her many blessings.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.showbizspy.com%2Farticle%2F220624%2Fsofia-vergara-god-doesnt-care-if-i-wear-nail-polish-or-not.html" title="Sofia Vergara: &quot;GOD DOESN&apos;T CARE IF I WEAR NAIL POLISH OR NOT.&quot;">[5]</a>

## American Politics of the Latin Variety

There's not a whole lot to say about Vergara's political involvement. Conjectures could be made from the previous quote: that she thinks accepting gay people is a good thing. Such an attitude might designate one as a bit of a liberal.

The twist is that Vergara's on-again, off-again boyfriend/fiancee, Nick Loeb, is quite politically active. Loeb is a wealthy businessman with a long history of supporting Republicans. Loeb has contributed over $7,000 to Republican political candidates since 2005<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Ffec%2Fbystate_detail.php%3Fst%3DFL%26last%3DLOEB%26first%3DNICK" title="Nick Loeb&apos;s Federal campaign contribution report">[6]</a> and even considered running for a Florida U.S. Senate seat on the Republican ticket.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fmiamiherald.typepad.com%2Fnakedpolitics%2F2012%2F05%2Falmost-senate-candidate-nick-loeb-splits-from-actress-sofia-vergara-for-now.html" title="Almost-Senate candidate Nick Loeb splits from actress Sofia Vergara. For Now">[7]</a>

What's that got to do with Vergara's political views? Admittedly not much except that she said she supports his political aspirations:

>Of course I will help him [with his campaign], why not? I support him with everything. If that's what he wants to do in his life, I will be there for him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celebitchy.com%2F171036%2Fsofia_vergara_supports_her_republican_boyfriends_political_plans%2F" title="Sofia Vergara supports her Republican boyfriend&apos;s political plans">[8]</a>

Plus, she was pretty friendly with Republican New Jersey governor Chris Christie at a White House Correspondent's Dinner.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Farticles.nydailynews.com%2F2012-05-01%2Fnews%2F31523625_1_sofia-vergara-chris-christie-jimmy-kimmel" title="Gov. Christie: Sofia Vergara consoled me when Kimmel made fat jokes">[9]</a>

My guess is that if Vergara were pinned down, she would more relate to Democrats than Republicans. Her stance on gay rights and her minority background almost guarantee it.
