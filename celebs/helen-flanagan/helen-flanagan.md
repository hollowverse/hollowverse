Helen Flanagan was born and raised in Bury, Greater Manchester, England.

Flanagan isn't known for her intelligence. Whether that's a fair characterization or not, it doesn't seem that she's done any serious thinking on either religion or politics. She definitely gets into the Christmas spirit, so a Christian, probably Anglican, background of some sort is highly likely–but her festivities probably revolve around shopping more than deep contemplation about the nativity of the baby Jesus.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2248801%2FHelen-Flanagan-misses-train-home-Manchester-Christmas-shopping-spree-London.html" title="Helen Flanagan misses train home to Manchester after Christmas shopping spree in London.">[1]</a>

She did mention that she was planning on going back to school to complete some of those courses she never cared to take as a teenager, including religious studies, so maybe some academic rigor will spark a new-found devotion to God.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesun.co.uk%2Fsol%2Fhomepage%2Fshowbiz%2Ftv%2F4723619%2Fhelen-flanagan-university.html" title="Helen Flanagan studies for university.">[2]</a> She included the hashtag "#spiritual" in the bio section of her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/helenflanagan1) account,<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fhelenflanagan1" title="Helen Flanagan (helenflanagan1) on Twitter.">[3]</a> so maybe she's got some latent belief in there after all. Keep us updated in the comments, won't you?

As far as politics go, I don't think there's going to be much updating needed. It doesn't look like Flanagan has any interest in entering the political conversation, unless it's by accident.

Just a few days after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in 2012, the actress tweeted a picture of herself holding a gun to her head. It was from a photo shoot she had done previously, and she was trying to make a statement about how hung over she was. Not surprisingly, she didn't get a great reaction.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2250335%2FHelen-Flanagan-apologises-Twitter-gun-photo-Daybreak.html" title="Helen Flanagan apologises for Twitter gun photo on Daybreak.">[4]</a>

She deleted the photo and apologized with tears on a talk show the next day, but her reckless posting had some politicians asking why she was posing with a gun in the first place, and reiterating that firearms are "intrinsically dangerous" and should not be glamorized.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2250335%2FHelen-Flanagan-apologises-Twitter-gun-photo-Daybreak.html" title="Helen Flanagan apologises for Twitter gun photo on Daybreak.">[5]</a>

Oh, Twitter. Providing so many opportunities for celebrity missteps.
