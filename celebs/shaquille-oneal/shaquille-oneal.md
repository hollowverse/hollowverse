Shaquille O'Neal was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey.

O'Neal is a Muslim. His first and middle name–Shaquille and Rashaun–mean "little one" and "warrior" in Arabic, respectively.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fallisondawnpr.com%2Fblog%2Fcelebrity-interviews-2%2Fmy-shaquille-oneal-interview-for-pr-com-we-talk-about-shaq-uncut-my-story%2F" title="My Shaquille O&apos;Neal Interview for PR.com.">[1]</a> He is devout in his faith, saying:

>Of course I believe in God. Only God could have given me what I have.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Farticles.latimes.com%2F2003%2Fjan%2F11%2Fsports%2Fsp-shaq11" title="Shaquille O&apos;neal Muslim – O&apos;Neal Issues Apology">[2]</a>

Furthermore, O'Neal has stated his intention to participate in the sacred Muslim right of passage known as Hajj, where Muslims travel to the holy city of Mecca.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DCKNK4rc_gxU" title="Shaquille O&apos;Neal Has Become A Muslim!!!">[3]</a>

However, Shaq doesn't want to exclude or alienate others of different faiths. And somewhat confusingly, he said:

>You believe what they believe, you respect what they respect, and you respect that person as a man or a woman, and you'll make it far in life. Fact is I'm Muslim, I'm Jewish, I'm Buddhist, I'm everybody 'cause I'm a people person.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fallisondawnpr.com%2Fblog%2Fcelebrity-interviews-2%2Fmy-shaquille-oneal-interview-for-pr-com-we-talk-about-shaq-uncut-my-story%2F" title="My Shaquille O&apos;Neal Interview for PR.com.">[4]</a>

Also, Shaq is a high-ranking member of an organization long shrouded in mystery and intrigue–the Freemasons.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Ffreemasonsfordummies.blogspot.com%2F2011%2F06%2Fbrother-shaquille-oneal.html" title="Brother Shaquille O&apos;Neal">[5]</a> It is often speculated that at their secretive meetings, the Freemasons plan the fate of great men and the governance of the worlds of politics and finance.


## Political center

O'Neal is active in politics–both nationally and locally. In his adopted hometown of Los Angeles, O'Neal endorsed a District Attorney candidate named Carmen Trutanich–a non-partisan position. O'Neal recorded a phone message that was used to call potential Tratanich supporters that said, among other things:

>Trust me. I don't get involved in politics very often. But, as a father and police officer, when it comes to our kids, I'm going to get involved. You should too by voting for Carmen Trutanich for District Attorney.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Flaist.com%2F2012%2F05%2F10%2Fshaquille_oneal_wants_to_call_you_t.php" title="Shaquille O&apos;Neal Wants to Talk to You About  L.A. Politics.">[6]</a>

Trutanich lost.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scpr.org%2Fnews%2F2012%2F06%2F06%2F32717%2Fdissecting-biggest-poltiical-upset-2012-trutanichs%2F" title="Dissecting the biggest political upset of 2012: Why Carmen Trutanich lost his bid for LA district attorney">[7]</a> But when someone is involved in local politics, it's usually a sign that they truly care.

However, indicating his party affiliation, O'Neal endorsed Barack Obama in 2012, saying:

>It's a hard job… You can't please everybody but I think he's doing a fabulous job. The world is in a little bit of turmoil right now — the economy's down — but… he's going to pick it back up and I think he's going to win this next election.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.reuters.com%2Ftalesfromthetrail%2F2011%2F11%2F28%2Fshaq-throws-in-support-for-obama-in-2012%2F" title="Shaq throws in support for Obama in 2012">[8]</a>

Given Shaq's effectiveness with the Trutanich campaign, Obama supporters might not be happy to hear that.
