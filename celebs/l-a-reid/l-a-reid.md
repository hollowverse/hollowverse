Anotonio "L.A." Reid was born and raised in Cincinnati, Ohio.

There is no information floating around about Reid's religious or spiritual beliefs, or the lack thereof. I'm guessing reporters are probably less interested in asking record executives about their religious beliefs than they're interested in the musicians themselves, so it's possible that he has some deep hidden faith about which we know nothing.

Looking at his hometown of Cincinnati, a little less than half of its population today affiliate with a religion which is right in line with the national average–<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.city-data.com%2Fcounty%2Freligion%2FHamilton-County-OH.html" title="Religions in Hamilton County, Ohio.">[1]</a> and doesn't really help us to make an educated guess. There was a religious resurgence in the U.S. when he was a young child,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.encyclopedia.com%2Fdoc%2F1G2-3468302049.html" title="The 1950s: Religion: Overview.">[2]</a> so if Cincinnati stayed near the national average, it's more like a 60% chance that he grew up religious–but again that's not much help.

I'm going to guess, until one of you diligent readers proves me wrong, that Reid is non-religious. Let us know in the comments if you know otherwise.


## Money talks, so why say anything?

Reid is definitely a Democrat. His campaign contribution report is a little hard to tease out, but as far as I can tell, he has donated $33,000 to Democratic candidates and political action committees since 1990.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsmeat.com%2Ffec%2Fbystate_detail.php%3Fst%3DGA%26last%3Dreid%26first%3Dantonio" title="antonio reid&apos;s federal campaign contribution search results.">[3]</a>

He may not have been the most vocal Obama supporter, but the day after the president was elected to a second term, he tweeted this,

>We are the change that we seek." -Barack Obama #BeEpic<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FLA_Reid%2Fstatus%2F266329381683736576" title="LA_Reid: We are the change that we …">[4]</a>

And that's about all we have on Reid's political beliefs. We know where he stands, but he's not going to talk about it all day. It seems as if he likes to keep his personal beliefs to himself. Fair enough.
