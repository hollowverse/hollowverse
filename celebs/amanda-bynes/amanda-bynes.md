Amanda Bynes was born in Thousand Oaks, California.

Bynes' father is Catholic and her mother is Jewish, and she says she grew up with both religions. Her parents told her she could decide for herself to which one she would adhere, but it doesn't sound like she's pinned anything down yet. She said,

>I'm sort of a spiritual person anyway. I believe in being morally correct–treating other people like you like to be treated–karma. . . . I think there is something else going on. I haven't decided yet [on a religion]. I don't know yet exactly what I believe.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interfaithfamily.com%2Farts_and_entertainment%2Fpopular_culture%2FShes_the_Man_A_Q%26A_with_Amanda_Bynes.shtml%3Frd%3D2" title="Shes the Man: A Q&amp;A with Amanda Bynes.">[1]</a>

So maybe she's feeling a little Hindu as well with the karma statement? Although she did identify herself as a "Jewish girl with curly hair" in one interview.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Flife%2Fmovies%2Fnews%2F2007-07-22-hairspray-cast_N.htm" title="&apos;Hairspray&apos; stars reflect talent.">[2]</a> But even if that reveals an identity of sorts, it doesn't necessarily say much for her religious views.

Until we hear more from the actress, she'll be agnostic in our books.


## I'll Endorse You If You Get Me Out of This Mess?

Bynes hasn't weighed in too much on the political debate, but she appears to lean to the left side of things. She supports gay marriage anyway. After the New York legislature passed a law legalizing same-sex marriage, Bynes tweeted:

>Congratulations New York!!!!! #MarriageEquality<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hispanicbusiness.com%2F2011%2F6%2F27%2Fcelebrities_celebrate_ny_gay_marriage_vote.htm" title="Celebrities Celebrate NY Gay Marriage Vote Via Twitter.">[3]</a>

She also seems to think that her and the President are on good enough terms that she can appeal to him for personal favors. But she also might need a lesson on how the executive branch works. When she was charged with drunk driving and a hit and run after allegedly running into a police car, she tweeted this:

>Hey @BarackObama… I don't drink. Please fire the cop who arrested me. I also don't hit and run. The end.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Flatimesblogs.latimes.com%2Flanow%2F2012%2F06%2Famanda-bynes-tweets-barack-obama-fire-the-cop-who-arrested-me.html" title="Amanda Bynes tweets Barack Obama: &apos;Fire the cop who arrested me.&apos;">[4]</a>

As of the writing of this article, Bynes hadn't worked her way out of her legal mess yet, and it looks like Obama had more pressing matters on his agenda than fulfilling Bynes' request. Best of luck to the actress, though, on working it out on her own.
