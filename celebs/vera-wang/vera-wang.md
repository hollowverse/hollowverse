Vera Wang was born and raised in New York City.

There's not much information about Wang's religion. She's mentioned a few things here and there, but they don't amount to a coherent description of her religious worldview. In one article, while talking about her fashion philosophy, she said,

>God is in the details.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mediabistro.com%2Fportfolios%2Fsamples_files%2F311160_ae4VsaAhyV_hhIwAfRb2je_9l.pdf" title="Vera Wang: Style Advice from the Queen of Elegance.">[1]</a>

Who knows if God is in her prayers or her heart, but He's definitely in the details of fashion. In another interview, she gave an indication that she could be interested in the some eastern philosophies. She said,

>I've also begun trying to meditate, which is the hardest thing I've ever learned.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.harpersbazaar.com%2Ffashion%2Ffashion-articles%2F24-hours-with-vera-wang-1112%23slide-1" title="Vera Wang in 24 Hours – A Day in the Life of Vera Wang.">[2]</a>

But I couldn't find any other references she's made to Buddhism and any other meditation-focused practice. So, it appears that Wang is non-religious. If you know any different, let us know in the comments.


## Wang and the money trail

Wang is a Democrat, mostly. The large majority of her hefty donations go to Democrats, including over $100,000 through the years to the Democratic National Committee. But she'll throw in for the occasional Republican as well, including Rudy Giuliani's 2008 presidential bid<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org%2Fnews%2F2011%2F09%2Ffashion-week-in-washington.html" title="Fashion Week&apos;s Political Players: From Vera Wang to Vogue.">[3]</a> and Mitt Romney's 2012 campaign.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org%2Forgs%2Fsummary.php%3Fid%3DD000030806%26cycle%3D2012" title="Vera Wang: Summary.">[4]</a>

Which is weird. Because she also donated close to $10,000 to Obama's campaigns in both 2008 and 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.opensecrets.org%2Fnews%2F2011%2F09%2Ffashion-week-in-washington.html" title="Fashion Week&apos;s Political Players: From Vera Wang to Vogue.">[5]</a> Maybe she was hedging her bets. But you'd never know it, because she sure acted like an Obama fan. Wang joined other fashion designers in creating the line "Runway to Win" to raise money for the Obama campaign in 2012. They ended up bringing in a respectable $40 million to stock the president's election coffers.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F11%2F23%2Fobama-campaign-fashion-line_n_2177671.html" title="Obama Campaign Fashion Line Raises $40 Million.">[6]</a>

So despite a few thousand bucks to Republicans here and there, we're going to call her a Democrat. Unfortunately, we don't have any statements from Wang about why she supports the left. She hasn't spoken out about gay marriage, immigration, health care, or anything else. Apparently, she lets her money and her [gowns](http://www.tomandlorenzo.com/2011/12/michelle-obama-in-vera-wang.html) do the talking.
