Skylar Grey, whose real name is Holly Hafermann, was born in Mazomanie, Wisconsin.

Grey hasn't mentioned much about religion, except when talking about her choice of stage name. She said,

>Gray became my favorite color when I was going through a time in my life that was full of uncertainty. The color gray became a religion to me. Within the 'undefined' or 'gray' areas lies an infinite amount of possibilities. Believing in this helped me have hope for a positive shift in my future, as I was treading water in a sea of unknowns.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Flife%2Fmusic%2Fnews%2F2011-03-10-skylargrey10_ST_N.htm" title="Skylar Grey finally shows her true colors.">[1]</a>

So, if gray is her religion, maybe Christianity isn't? Considering she never talks about God or church or praying, I think it's safe to assume she fairly non-religious.


## Escaping the red

Although I couldn't find any place where Grey endorsed Obama or explicitly talked about any political issues, I'm pretty sure she's at least a little liberal, even if mostly non-political.

She talks about her childhood growing up in "Middle America"–the sea of generally red states–as something she was glad to escape, a place where she never felt accepted. Plus she said she can relate to her gay fans for that reason.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fguidetogay.com%2Fthe-news%2Finterviews%2F960-skylar-grey-qits-hard-to-be-accepted-a-seen-for-who-you-are-insideq" title="Skylar Grey: &quot;It&apos;s Hard to Be Accepted &amp; Seen For Who You Are Inside.">[2]</a>
