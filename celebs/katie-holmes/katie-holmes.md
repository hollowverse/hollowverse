Katie Holmes was born and raised in Toledo, Ohio.

Holmes was raised a Catholic and graduated from an all-girls Catholic school in her hometown.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0005017%2Fbio" title="Katie Holmes – Biography.">[1]</a> Catholicism isn't something Holmes has spoken much about, but her religious background goes quite a bit deeper than that.

In 2006, Holmes married into the controversial Church of Scientology. The groom? None other than Scientology's most enthusiastic spokesperson, Tom Cruise. During their courtship, Holmes said things like:

>I'm really excited about [Scientology]. I know how important it is to Tom, and I want to be able to share that with him.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C1072887%2C00.html" title="Katie Holmes&apos; New Friend Raises Eyebrows">[2]</a>

The real story came when, in the summer of 2012, Holmes filed for divorce from Cruise. Rumors flew that Scientology was central in the split. Most specifically, reports that the church took issue with how Holmes wanted to discipline her daughter, Suri, sent Katie over the edge.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.insideedition.com%2Fnews%2F8524%2Fkatie-holmes-returns-to-catholic-church.aspx" title="Katie Holmes Returns to Catholic Church">[3]</a>

Following the divorce, Holmes expressed fear that the Church of Scientology was having her followed and she feared for her safety.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nypost.com%2Fp%2Fnews%2Fnational%2Fcruise_god_squad_XHTokIuxX47ZHdFlsVbhBJ%23ixzz1zSpnaqMe" title="Katie Holmes fears bullying Scientology thugs outside her building">[4]</a> All the while, fans of mainstream religion were relieved to hear that this sweet girl-next-door had returned to the Catholic Church, registering at Manhattan's St. Francis Xavier parish<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.insideedition.com%2Fnews%2F8524%2Fkatie-holmes-returns-to-catholic-church.aspx" title="Katie Holmes Returns to Catholic Church">[5]</a> and enrolling her daughter in the Convent of the Sacred Heart Catholic School.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwonderwall.msn.com%2Fmovies%2Fkatie-holmes-enrolls-suri-cruise-at-convent-of-sacred-heart-report-1693357.story" title="Report: Katie Holmes Enrolls Suri Cruise at Convent of Sacred Heart">[6]</a>

## Dianetic politics

Holmes has never really expressed her position on political or social topics. This could be because she was snatched up by Scientology at a young age and was obligated to take their view on social issues. For example, Scientology considers being gay an illness and reports have surfaced of their attempts to "cure" it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FScientology_and_sexual_orientation" title="Scientology and sexual orientation">[7]</a> Furthermore, despite the fact that Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard wrote negatively of abortion, reports have surfaced regarding forced abortions during the church's offshore activities.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FScientology_and_abortion" title="Scientology and abortion">[8]</a>

This is, of course, pure conjecture, and perhaps we can expect some politicking now that Holmes is a single, Catholic woman. Now, she's being hailed by some as a feminist hero who broke free from an oppressive husband and his oppressive religion.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2FPolitics%2FOTUS%2Fleaving-tom-cruise-makes-katie-holmes-feminist-hero%2Fstory%3Fid%3D16768538%23.UDUCdEQ1at8" title="Why leaving Tom Cruise makes Katie Holmes a feminist hero">[9]</a>
