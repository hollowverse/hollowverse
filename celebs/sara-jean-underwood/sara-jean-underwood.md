summaries:
---

Sara Jean Underwood was born in Portland, Oregon and grew up in Scappoose, Oregon.

It's not entirely clear where Underwood stands in the religion department. She could be Christian since she appeared in a Christmas [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8_NbCbX3gc). But it was as a Playmate of the Year representative for Playboy magazine, and was more about her ability to perform a provocative dance in a Santa suit than it was about celebrating the birth of Jesus.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DJ8_NbCbX3gc" title="Merry christmas with Sara Jean Underwood PMOY 2007.">[1]</a>

Or maybe she finds her spirituality in her practice of yoga. She is invested enough in the discipline to enter competitions, but also uses it as a way to seduce internet-surfers with the naked yoga videos she made in association with Playboy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.esscurve.com%2F1076%2Fsara-jean-underwood-masters-yoga-nude" title="Sara Jean Underwood Sleek, Sexy, Nude Yoga Master.">[2]</a>

But in the end, if I had to make a guess, I would say Underwood appears to be utterly non-religious.

If Underwood is not religious, she isÂ really not political. I couldn't find a lick of information about her political affiliation or opinion on any remotely political topic. Maybe she's a Libertarian because she doesn't believe government should be able to regulate adult content in magazines or online. Or maybe she is a Republican because she doesn't want to pay high taxes on her $1.5 million income.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.celebritynetworth.com%2Frichest-celebrities%2Fmodels%2Fsara-jean-underwood-net-worth%2F" title="Sara Jean Underwood.">[3]</a>

But at this point we're all speculation. If you have some insight on Underwood's beliefs, let us know in the comments!
