Josh Peck was born and raised in New York City.

He grew up with a Jewish mother.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fusatoday30.usatoday.com%2Flife%2Fpeople%2F2004-08-25-peck_x.htm" title="Josh Peck lightens up.">[1]</a> In other words, he's Jewish. But for him, it's more of a culture than a religion. He said,

>You inherently feel Jewish no matter what. Where I draw my spirituality from is still being decided. But culturally I feel it's very much a part of my core.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jweekly.com%2Farticle%2Ffull%2F35288%2Fyoung-jewish-actor-director-give-in-to-wackness%2F" title="Young Jewish actor, director give in to &quot;Wackness.&quot;">[2]</a>

I couldn't find any other interview where he elaborated on what spirituality means to him, so with that, we'll just have to settle for agnostic Jew.


## Chinese, North Koreans, Zombies. Whatever.

Peck doesn't appear to care much at all about the political state of the country. There was no mention of the 2012 presidential election on his Twitter feed–not even a joke.

He did star in the remake of Red Dawn, which has a pretty strong political premise: in this version, North Korea attacks the U.S. and an unlikely band of highschoolers save the day. He didn't have anything to say about the volatile Asian nation though. In fact, the film was originally shot with Chinese invaders, but the studio changed it to North Korea in order to attract Chinese audiences. And that didn't bother Peck a bit. He said it could have been zombies as far as he was concerned.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2012%2F11%2F19%2Fjosh-peck-red-dawn_n_2162098.html" title="Josh Peck, &apos;Red Dawn&apos; Star, On The Frustration Of His Movie Being On The Shelf For 3 Years.">[3]</a>

So we'll slap him with a non-political label unless one of you readers has a lead for us. Let us know in the comments if you do.
