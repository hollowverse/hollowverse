Mylène Farmer, born Mylène Jeanne Gautier, was born in Pierrefonds, Quebec, Canada and grew up there as well as in a suburb of Paris, France called Ville-d'Avray.

There's no putting Farmer in a religious box. She seems to be most influenced by the Catholic faith. First of all, she's French. Second of all, her controversial [music video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5rwVEHweTg) for the song, "Je te rends ton amour," is stuffed with Catholic imagery–some of it a bit disturbing. The video was condemned by the Catholic Church and many French networks wouldn't play it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.queersongs.net%2Findex.asp%3Fmodulo%3Dgayicon%26artistid%3D89" title="Mylène Farmer">[1]</a>

Some speculate that the song and video combination is Farmer's way of saying she renounces religion or faith or God, as the title translates to "I'm Giving My Love Back."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fvertige-de-mylene.tumblr.com%2F" title="L&apos;Amour Naissant">[2]</a>

I wouldn't necessarily dispute that. She seems anti-religious in a way. One generally reputable source says she is "opposed" to religion,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0267785%2Fbio" title="Mylène Farmer – Biography">[3]</a> though I couldn't find any first-hand statements from Farmer on the topic.


## Les Politiques jolie

Farmer isn't too explicitly political either. It's not surprising, she's notoriously private.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0267785%2Fbio" title="Mylène Farmer – Biography">[4]</a> Her song, "Desenchantée," (translation: disenchanted) is considered a political song by some. The only semi-political thing I could find in it were the lyrics (translated):

>I am of a disenchanted generation. Disenchanted./Who could prevent me from/understanding all?/When reason collapses, To what womb should we turn to?<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sing365.com%2Fmusic%2Flyric.nsf%2FDesenchant%25C3%25A9e-English-and-Polish-translation-lyrics-Kate-Ryan%2F259176092097AE4948256D6500143739" title="Desenchantée – English and Polish translation Lyrics – Kate Ryan">[5]</a>

Cryptic–another one of Farmer's calling cards. I suppose many of us could relate to feeling disenchanted with the current political environment, wanting to return to some non-existent ideal.
