Christina Hendricks was born in Knoxville, Tennessee and grew up in Portland, Oregon, Twin Falls, Idaho, and Fairfax, Virginia.

Either Hendricks doesn't have anything to say about religion or nobody's asked her. Even question/answer sites, the usual sources of totally unreliable personal information about celebrities, don't have anything to say.

She married actor Geoffrey Arend in 2009 who some people seem to think is Jewish, although nobody knows for sure.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.squidoo.com%2Fgeoffrey-arend" title="Geoffrey Arend.">[1]</a> Another dead end in the religion department.

So I'm going to have to go with non-religious on this one until further notice.


## Confident, Curvy, and Liberal

Although Hendricks doesn't appear to have endorsed any Democratic candidates, I'm going to assume she's liberal–at least socially.

She's an advocate for same-sex marriage, and doesn't seem to think that being gay should even be an issue. Referring to a same-sex on-screen kiss, Hendricks was asked if it was the first time she kissed a woman. She said, "Oh, come now. It's 2009!"<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.advocate.com%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftelevision%2F2009%2F10%2F12%2Fahead-curves" title="Ahead of the Curves.">[2]</a> And she said this about Proposition 8, a California ballot measure that passed making gay marriage illegal:

>I have a million friends affected by the passing of Prop. 8. The sad thing is that people were so used to how unfair it is that it wasn't that shocking.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.advocate.com%2Farts-entertainment%2Ftelevision%2F2009%2F10%2F12%2Fahead-curves" title="Ahead of the Curves.">[3]</a>

And since the most popular topic of conversation surrounding the actress is her voluptuous figure, let's jump on the bandwagon. She's been labelled as a role model for everyday women who don't fit into the size zero Hollywood stereotype.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Ffashion.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews-features%2FTMG7909143%2FMad-Men-star-Christina-Hendricks-is-great-role-model-says-Equalities-Minister.html" title="Mad Men star Christina Hendricks is great role model, says Equalities Minister.">[4]</a> And she embraces her figure saying that it makes her feel womanly and beautiful,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.cnn.com%2F2010%2FHEALTH%2F07%2F06%2Fchristina.hendricks.confident%2Findex.html" title="Christina Hendricks: Curvy, confident, gorgeous.">[5]</a> and encourages other women to be confident about their own bodies:

>It's important to embrace who you are and celebrate who you are and we are all completely different and I think that's gorgeous.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.smh.com.au%2Flifestyle%2Ffashion%2Fhollywoods-voluptuous-beauty-was-offended-go-full-figure-20121013-27jp5.html" title="Hollywood&apos;s voluptuous beauty was offended? Go (ful) figure…">[6]</a>

So even though the actress would prefer people to talk a little less about her body, and a little more about her acting,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mirror.co.uk%2F3am%2Fi-work-my-butt-off-but-all-they-want-to-talk-about-is-my-body-736479" title="I work my butt off but all they want to talk about is my body.">[7]</a> she is still a positive physical role model for women in a profession with few of them.
