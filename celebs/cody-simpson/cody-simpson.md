Cody Simpson was born in Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia. He moved to Los Angeles with his family when he was thirteen to pursue his music career.

Simpson is definitely a Christian, but what denomination remains a mystery. There is a healthy Catholic population in his home state in Australia,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fprofile.id.com.au%2FDefault.aspx%3Fid%3D400%26pg%3D106%26gid%3D130%26type%3Denum" title="Religion – Queensland – Australia Community Profile.">[1]</a> but there's no indication that he is Catholic. Regardless of the specifics, he sure seems to pray a lot. He prays before shows,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.mcall.com%2Flehighvalleymusic%2F2012%2F02%2Fa-day-in-the-life-of-tween-idol-cody-simpson.html" title="Spending a day with &apos;tween idol Cody Simpson.">[2]</a> he prayed for Japan after the earthquake and tsunami in 2011,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpopdirt.com%2Fpop-artists-tweet-well-wishes-to-japan-following-earthquake%2F81425%2F" title="Pop Artists Tweet Well Wishes To Japan Following Earthquake.">[3]</a> and even wears shirts imploring others to "Pray for Snow."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fcoolspotters.com%2Fmusicians%2Fcody-simpson%2Fand%2Fclothing%2Faviator-nation-pray-for-snow-crew-sweatshirt%2Fmedia%2F2418824%3Futm_campaign%3DTwitter%26utm_source%3Dcody-simpson_aviator-nation-%26utm_medium%3Dcoo.ly%23medium-2418824" title="Cody Simpson and Aviator Nation Pray For Snow Crew Sweatshirt.">[4]</a>

So, it's fairly obvious that Simpson is devout, but to what remains a mystery. One would assume it's to a Christian God he prays, but until he gets a little older and starts answering some hard questions about spirituality and life, it'll remain a mystery.

The fifteen-year-old also doesn't have a lot to say about politics, but he gets a little giddy talking about meeting President Obama.

>We got to meet the President and so that was pretty much the highlight of the tour right now… It was like the first time I had been truly like starstruck by meeting someone…
I met his daughters and all that kind of stuff. They wanted
like t-shirts of me. And I'm like, wow.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popscreen.com%2Fv%2F6yvCE%2FCody-Simpson-Talks-About-Meeting-President-Obamas-Daughters" title="Cody Simpson Talks About Meeting President Obama&apos;s Daughters.">[5]</a>

As a barely-pubescent teen, it's probably fair to say that Cody Simpson hasn't quite defined himself politically yet. He's obviously an Obama fan, but that definitely doesn't necessarily mean that he has a lot of opinions on his policies, or anyone's policies for that matter. He's just floating along on the teen stardom cloud for now.
