Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was born in Hayward, California and grew up in Auckland, New Zealand, Honolulu, Hawaii, and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania.

Johnson hasn't spoken much about his religious views, though his MySpace page indicates that he is "Christian-other."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.myspace.com%2Fashleyakaprincess" title="Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson on MySpace">[1]</a> Johnson has not indicated which denomination, if any, he subscribes to.

He was once cornered by an obviously religious reporter, who wouldn't let him deflect her religious inquiries. While Johnson was crediting God to getting him through the uncertain times in his life and his career, the reporter was asking, among other things, "What do you do spiritually in life to develop your soul and what does God actually mean to you?" To which Johnson replied:

>I have my own special relationship with God… I feel very blessed, I count my blessings every day.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DO2rFdVRy4vk" title="Dwayne &quot;The Rock&quot; Johnson Spiritual Side of Hollywood">[2]</a>

It sort of seems like a stock answer, something publicists and PR professionals tell their clients to say in the event of a religious line of questioning. He once said:

>To a degree, all of my promos are scripted…<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0425005%2Fbio" title="Dwayne Johnson (I) – Biography">[3]</a>

Still, this does indicate that Johnson is at least somewhat religious.


## Rock-solid politics

Johnson is politically ambiguous, having registered as an Independent at least once.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nndb.com%2Fpeople%2F062%2F000028975%2F" title="The Rock">[4]</a>  But he performed at the 2000 Republican National Convention in 2000<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailyshow.com%2Fwatch%2Fthu-august-3-2000%2Findecision-2000---the-rock" title="Indecision 2000 – The Rock – The Daily Show with Jon Stewart – 08/03/00">[5]</a> but attended the Democratic National Convention the same year.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nndb.com%2Fpeople%2F062%2F000028975%2F" title="The Rock">[6]</a>

However, Johnson has been part of a wrestling-derived organization designed to increase voter turnout regardless of any partisan ideology. It's called the Smackdown Your Vote!<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20110511213126%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.allbusiness.com%2Fgovernment%2Felections-politics-campaigns-elections%2F6040691-1.html" title="Smackdown Your Vote! Announces New Members, WWF Superstar Kurt Angle Named Honorary Chairman">[7]</a> So maybe partisanship is not that important to Johnson.

His financial contributions to society have been rather neutral and educational in nature, including a cool $1 million to the University of Miami<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DESu84OTiwXQ" title="Dwayne &apos;The Rock&apos; Johnson donates $1 million">[8]</a> and $1,000 to the Valley Education Fund in Sherman Oaks, California.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2F68.234.14.2%2Ffec%2Fbystate_detail.php%3Fst%3D%26zip%3D91423%26last%3DJOHNSON%26first%3DDWAYNE" title="Dwayne Johnson&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report">[9]</a> All things considered, Johnson seems rather moderate in his views.

He has expressed a desire to possibly pursue a career in politics and is a confirmed friend of actor and politician Arnold Schwarzenegger.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0425005%2Fbio" title="Dwayne Johnson (I) – Biography">[10]</a> He once said:

>I wouldn't rule [a political career] out. I think in order for politicians to be successful, you have to be passionate about politics. I care about our country, but right now I can make impact in other ways.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2012%2F04%2F25%2Frock-in-chief-dwayne-rock-johnson-on-whether-or-not-will-pursue-politics%2F" title="Rock-in-Chief? Dwayne &apos;The Rock&apos; Johnson could pursue future in politics">[11]</a>

Hey, Jesse Ventura did it, and he's awesome.
