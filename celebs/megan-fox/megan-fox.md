Megan Fox was born in Oak Ridge, Tennessee.

Fox's upbringing was heavily Catholic and she attended a Catholic school for the entirety of her education.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parade.com%2Fcelebrity%2Fcelebrity-parade%2F2009%2F0915-megan-fox-jennifers-body.html" title="Megan Fox: &apos;My Sense of Humor Doesn&apos;t Translate">[1]</a>

But there's something fishy going on here. In one interview, she says:

>I was raised Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.parade.com%2Fcelebrity%2Fcelebrity-parade%2F2009%2F0915-megan-fox-jennifers-body.html" title="Megan Fox: &apos;My Sense of Humor Doesn&apos;t Translate">[2]</a>

Very simple and straightforward, right? But in another interview, she goes into depth about the fundamentalism of a Pentecostal church she regularly attended growing up.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2013%2F01%2F16%2Fmegan-fox-devout-pentecostal-esquire-speaks-in-tongues_n_2489730.html" title="Megan Fox, Devout Pentecostal, Tells Esquire She Speaks in Tongues">[3]</a> Pentecostal denominations are some of the most, shall we say, involved sects of Christianity. These are the convulsions-on-the-floor, speaking-in-tongues, healing-the-sick-onstage churches. She said:

>The energy is so intense in the room that you feel like anything can happen. They're going to hate that I compare it to this, but have you ever watched footage of a Santeria gathering or someone doing voodoo? You know how palpable the energy is? Whatever's going on there, it's for real.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2013%2F01%2F16%2Fmegan-fox-devout-pentecostal-esquire-speaks-in-tongues_n_2489730.html" title="Megan Fox, Devout Pentecostal, Tells Esquire She Speaks in Tongues">[4]</a>

I'm not sure the reason behind this double-speak.

However, even though she was inundated with heavy-handed religion for so long, it doesn't seem to have stuck with Fox, who now regularly attends services at a non-denominational Christian church with her husband. It would appear, as per her description, that her current church is rather liberal with its policies and recommendations, and that's a big plus for Fox. She says:

>I've always been intrigued and repulsed by how divisive and hateful different Christian denominations are to one another despite their obvious commonalities and interconnections. [The church I attend is] not judgmental, does not close its doors to anybody, and has a young, active, passionate congregation, which is how I like to experience church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fcelebrity-gossip.net%2Fmegan-fox%2Fmegan-fox-talks-religion-honesty-miami-magazine-588996" title="Megan Fox Talks Religion, Honesty With MIAMI Magazine">[5]</a>

Despite the fact that Fox just oozes sexuality and sensuality, she seems to be a rather traditionally-minded girl who doesn't like to party<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangaloremirror.com%2Findex.aspx%3Fpage%3Darticle%26sectid%3D23%26contentid%3D2010061520100615192226792f04eb8f7" title="Megan doesn&apos;t like to party, Entertainment – Hollywood">[6]</a> and enjoys her "normal" life with her husband and child.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ibtimes.com%2Farticles%2F306822%2F20120229%2Fmegan-fox-manhattan-magazine-interview.htm" title="Megan Fox Talks, Religion, and Super Powers in Manhattan Magazine">[7]</a> She says:

>Oddly you wouldn't think it, but I'm very domestic. That keeps me sane. I sort of distance myself from the Hollywood crowd.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bangaloremirror.com%2Findex.aspx%3Fpage%3Darticle%26sectid%3D23%26contentid%3D2010061520100615192226792f04eb8f7" title="Megan doesn&apos;t like to party, Entertainment – Hollywood">[8]</a>

## Robot Politics

Megan Fox's political views can be best understood when one grasps the nuances of the Transformers Universe. You see, a race of evil giant robots known as the Decepticons is hell-bent on taking over planet Earth and the only thing standing in their way is a race of good giant robots known as the Autobots.

Now, when Megan Fox was asked how she, personally, would handle a potential Decepticon invasion, she said she would prefer diplomatic negotiations with the Decepticon leader, Megatron, where she would make him an offer he can't refuse. She said:

>I'd barter with him and say instead of the entire planet, can you just take out all of the white trash, hillbilly, anti-gay, super bible-beating people in Middle America?<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rightreborn.com%2F2009%2F06%2F10%2Fmegan-fox-racist-antichristian-heterophobic-remarks%2F" title="Megan Fox: Racist, Anti-Christian, Heterophobic Remarks">[9]</a>

Well! Let's take this to its logical conclusion. She doesn't like people who are "anti-gay," which would make her "pro-gay." She doesn't like "bible-beaters" despite being admittedly religious herself. One could assume that she is quite militantly liberal, then.

Plus, she thinks Obama is sexy.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.freerepublic.com%2Ffocus%2Ff-chat%2F2143642%2Fposts" title="Megan Fox on Barack Obama: He&apos;s Very Sexy">[10]</a>
