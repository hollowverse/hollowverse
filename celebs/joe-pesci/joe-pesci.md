Joe Pesci was born and raised in Newark, New Jersey.

Information on Pesci's religious beliefs are surprisingly scant. Considering his Italian heritage,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000582%2Fbio" title="Joe Pesci – Biography.">[1]</a> it's pretty clear he was raised in at least a vaguely Catholic home.

And he seems to have some pretty strong feelings in favor of the Pope. When Sinead O'Connor, an outspoken critic of the Catholic church, ripped up a picture of Pope John Paul II on Saturday Night Live, Pesci responded the next week by presenting a taped up version of the picture. He said,

>Sinead O'Connor tore up a picture of the Pope and I thought that was wrong. . . . I would have gave her such a smack.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F1992%2F10%2F12%2Fnyregion%2Fchronicle-479092.html" title="CHRONICLE.">[2]</a>

We'll call him Catholic, but sadly that's all we have. If you have any other information for us, please let us know in the comments.

And there's even less to go on with Pesci's political beliefs. He just doesn't enter into the debate. I found several lists that claim he's a Republican,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fvoices.yahoo.com%2Fnot-all-celebrities-liberal-democrats-4980894.html%3Fcat%3D27" title="Not All Celebrities Are Liberal Democrats.">[3]</a> but those sites didn't list any sources for their claims.

If he really is a devout Catholic, and a supporter of the Pope, it seems likely that he would be socially conservative on issues like birth control, abortion, and gay marriage. But conjecture is all I can offer at this point. If you have any pointers for us, let us know!
