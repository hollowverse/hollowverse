Jay Sean, whose real name is Kamaljit Singh Jhooti, was born in London, England.

Sean's family is Sikh, a small religion that is primarily based in northwestern India. Sean is very proud of his religion and draws strength and inspiration from it. He said he won't talk about it out of respect, unless asked, but when he's asked, it's like opening the floodgates. He said:

>I love my faith. I absolutely love what Sikhism stands for.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpunjabijanta.com%2Freligious-videos%2Fjay-sean-discusses-sikhism-on-radio-simply-one%2F" title="Jay Sean discusses Sikhism on Radio Simply One">[1]</a>

Sean went on, in the same interview, to say that the historical battles between Hindus and Muslims and the Sikhs that stood up for their beliefs during that time period give him courage and conviction to do his own thing musically.

Music, to Sean, can bridge ideological divides and Sean hopes to participate in doing so. He said:

>If people can use music to find things in common rather than divide us, that would be beautiful. Instead of focusing on all of our differences, we should all celebrate what we have in common. White, black, latin, Pakistani, Indian, Muslim, Sikh, Hindu whatever, we all have too much in common to allow subtle differences to get on our wayâ€¦ Accept each other's culture and be positive. I really hope that my music, all the music in the world brings everyone together one way or another.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.desiclub.com%2Fdesimusic%2Fdesimusic_features%2Fmusic_article.cfm%3Fid%3D325" title="Jay Sean, Sitting On Top Of The World">[2]</a>

## Western politics of a south-asian

Sean's heritage has also inspired him to stand up politically. Now a resident of the United States, Sean has used his star power to promote Indian-American politicians. In 2010, Sean attended and helped to promote the Indian-American Leadership Initiative conference. That year, a record number of Indian-Americans were running for U.S. Congress. Sean said:

>I am really excited about participating in the IALI conference this weekend. I'm proud of these pioneering South Asians being celebrated for their individual talents and gifts, and happy to lend my support.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnews.avstv.com%2F2010%2F07%2F23%2Fjay-sean-lends-his-voice-to-politics%2F" title="Jay Sean Lends His Voice To Politics">[3]</a>

Sean didn't endorse any particular candidate or political ideology at the conference or afterward. His motivation for promoting Indian-American politicians seems to have been purely for cultural purposes.

Beyond that, Sean hasn't taken a political stand on any particular issue. So there's very little from which to assign him a political classification.

However, Sean has used his status to promote and raise money for various humanitarian causes including a performance at a UN-sponsored charity event which sought to raise money for disadvantaged children<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fau.news.yahoo.com%2Fworld%2Fa%2F-%2Fworld%2F13647928%2Fjay-sean-on-debuting-his-new-single-at-un-charity-event%2F" title="Jay Sean on debuting his new single at UN charity event">[4]</a> and performing at a benefit concert for the Shriner's Hospitals for Children.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.desihits.com%2Fnews%2Fview%2Fjay-sean-performs-at-justin-timberlakes-charity-concert-20091019" title="Jay Sean Performs at Justin Timberlake&apos;s Charity Concert">[5]</a>
