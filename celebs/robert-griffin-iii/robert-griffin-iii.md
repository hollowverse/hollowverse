Robert Griffin III was born into a military family in Okinawa, Japan. He and his family moved around often and he grew up in Tacoma, Washington, New Orleans, Louisiana and Copperas Cove, Texas.

If you know who Robert Griffin III is, you probably also know he's a devout Christian. Griffin seems to prefer the Evangelical/Pentecostal denominations, even though he attended Baylor University,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackchristiannews.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2F05%2Frobert-griffin-iii-my-relationship-with-god-is-my-most-important-influence.html" title="Robert Griffin III: &apos;My Relationship With God Is My Most Important Influence.">[1]</a> a Baptist University.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FBaylor_University" title="Baylor University">[2]</a> In his hometown of Copperas Cove, Texas, Griffin attended the Christian House of Prayer Ministries,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F04%2Frg3-and-a-tiny-glimpse-of-faith%2F" title="RG3 and a tiny glimpse of faith">[3]</a> and the most recent news is that, since he's been living in Washington D.C., he's been attending the Cornerstone Fellowship Church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F12%2Fyahoo-asks-robert-griffin-iii-one-rather-obvious-question%2F" title="Yahoo! asks Robert Griffin III a rather obvious question">[4]</a> Both of these churches have been described as "modern evangelical, charismatic/Pentecostal congregation[s]."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F12%2Fyahoo-asks-robert-griffin-iii-one-rather-obvious-question%2F" title="Yahoo! asks Robert Griffin III a rather obvious question">[5]</a>

Nevertheless, faith and God has always been a huge part of Griffin's life. He said of his upbringing:

>I've been in the church since I was 7. My parents didn't push it on us but they made sure we grew up in the church, so that's all we know, that's what we do.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackchristiannews.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2F05%2Frobert-griffin-iii-my-relationship-with-god-is-my-most-important-influence.html" title="Robert Griffin III: &apos;My Relationship With God Is My Most Important Influence.">[6]</a>

And as a rising NFL star, Griffin is always quick to praise God for his talents and good fortune–and he wants to get the word out:

>I praise God, I thank him for everything. Purposefully, you live every day for Him, and when He gives you the opportunity to speak up for Him or to do something in His name, you do it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackchristiannews.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2F05%2Frobert-griffin-iii-my-relationship-with-god-is-my-most-important-influence.html" title="Robert Griffin III: &apos;My Relationship With God Is My Most Important Influence.">[7]</a>

Griffin has caused some confusion by making the sign of the cross on the football field after particularly triumphant moments.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F04%2Frg3-and-a-tiny-glimpse-of-faith%2F" title="RG3 and a tiny glimpse of faith">[8]</a> I guess this uniquely Catholic symbol conflicts with Griffin's Protestant lifestyle. Probably trivial, but when you're famous and religious, people ask questions.


## Rumors and subterfuge in D.C.

Griffin graduated after three years at Baylor University with a degree in political science.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.blackchristiannews.com%2Fnews%2F2012%2F05%2Frobert-griffin-iii-my-relationship-with-god-is-my-most-important-influence.html" title="Robert Griffin III: &apos;My Relationship With God Is My Most Important Influence.">[9]</a> He could probably have an intelligent political conversation with the best of them–but he simply doesn't want to:

>There's a couple things you don't talk about in life, and that's race, religion and politics. I try to make sure I don't talk about politics at all.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F12%2Fyahoo-asks-robert-griffin-iii-one-rather-obvious-question%2F" title="Yahoo! asks Robert Griffin III a rather obvious question">[10]</a>

Well, he's clearly talked about religion. And race? Yeah, that too:

>For me, you don't ever want to be defined by the color of your skin. You want to be defined by your work ethic, the person that you are, your character, your personality. That's what I strive [for]. I am an African American, in America, and that will never change. But I don't have to be defined by that.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fblogs%2Ffootball-insider%2Fwp%2F2012%2F12%2F12%2Frobert-griffin-iii-talks-about-race%2F" title="Robert Griffin III talks about race">[11]</a>

But he has largely been able to stay out of the political conversation–mostly. He's said that his faith does inform his political worldview<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Fgetreligion%2F2012%2F12%2Fyahoo-asks-robert-griffin-iii-one-rather-obvious-question%2F" title="Yahoo! asks Robert Griffin III a rather obvious question">[12]</a> and he has cracked jokes with Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcwashington.com%2Fvideo%2F%23!%2Fblogs%2Fcapital-games%2FRobert-Griffin-III-Challenges-President-Obama%2F138592819" title="Robert Griffin III Challenges Obama">[13]</a>

Rumors abound that Griffin is a Republican. This particular conversation seems to have started with ESPN reporter, Rob Parker, who "heard" Griffin was a Republican and, as a result, called him out for not being black enough.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fopinion%2F2012%2F12%2F20%2Frobert-griffin-iii-rob-parker-and-sad-truth-about-our-racial-politics%2F" title="Robert Griffin III, Rob Parker and the sad truth about our racial politics">[14]</a> Ugh… This particular incident exposed this author to a new term for the first time: liberal racism.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fnewsbusters.org%2Fblogs%2Fken-shepherd%2F2012%2F12%2F19%2Fvideo-mrctvs-bob-parks-discusses-robert-griffin-iii-and-liberal-racism" title="Video: MRCTV&apos;s Bob Parks Discusses Robert Griffin III and Liberal Racism">[15]</a>

Haters gonna hate!
