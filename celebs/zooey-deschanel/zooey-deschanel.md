Zooey Deschanel was born and largely raised in the Los Angeles, California area, though she traveled quite a bit as a child as a result of her father's work, spending much of her childhood in places like East Africa and Yugoslavia.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DioSllC_4UdQ" title="Zooey Deschanel con Letterman">[1]</a>

Deschanel was raised a Catholic,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nextmovie.com%2Fblog%2Femily-deschanel-interview-the-perfect-family%2F" title="Q&amp;A: Emily Deschanel on Playing a &apos;Perfect&apos; Catholic Lesbian">[2]</a> but her father is a Quaker. Now, Deschanel doesn't claim any religious affiliation, saying:

>My family is liberal. I was raised in the 'you can be whatever you want' kind of way. And in the end, I was like, 'Eh.' I mean I'm interested in theology, and I love reading about it. But I don't attach myself to any one religion or other.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vulture.com%2F2011%2F09%2Fzooey_deschanel_new_girl_inter.html" title="Things You Learn After a Lot of Time Spent With Zooey Deschanel">[3]</a>

You might think Deschanel's interest in religion is purely academicâ€“particularly when you learn that her personal philosophy of life is to not eat too much sugar.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Farticles.mcall.com%2F2005-04-27%2Fnews%2F3608858_1_hitchhiker-s-zooey-deschanel-hitchhiker-s-guide-douglas-adams" title="Hitchhiker&apos;s Zooey Deschanel guides us through her life, the universe and everything">[4]</a> But it's more an agnostic's view Deschanel takes. She said:

>It's all about the question. And the question can be a lot of different ones. As humans, we're always questioning things and we're always coming up with new questions and that's kind of what we do best.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Farticles.mcall.com%2F2005-04-27%2Fnews%2F3608858_1_hitchhiker-s-zooey-deschanel-hitchhiker-s-guide-douglas-adams" title="Hitchhiker&apos;s Zooey Deschanel guides us through her life, the universe and everything">[5]</a>

## 

## Cutie-pie politics

Deschanel isn't just tuned into politics, politics is tuned into her. Deschanel received a personal letter from Barack Obama on her 32nd birthday, thanking her for helping young women thrive through her charity, HelloGiggles.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fzooey-deschanel-birthday-barack-obama-new-girl-283360" title="President Obama &apos;Grateful&apos; to Zooey Deschanel in Birthday Letter">[6]</a> It might, however, have been a thinly-disguised thank you note from the president for Deschanel's one and only financial contribution of $1,000 to Obama 2008 presidential campaign though.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Ffec%2Fbystate_detail.php%3Fst%3D%26zip%3D90403%26last%3DDeschanel%26first%3DZooey" title="Zooey Deschanel&apos;s federal campaign contribution search results">[7]</a>

So she's a Democrat and her previous quote about her religious upbringing would suggest she's a liberal as well. So would her opining about gay marriage. Deschanel frequently pushes for marriage equality at her concerts, saying things like:

>We're a generation that has progressed in many ways, from the ones before us. I think that the idea of romantic love is about marriage is over. Now all love is romantic love. Getting married is not a necessity, and staying with one person is not a necessity.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.catholicvote.org%2Fdiscuss%2Findex.php%3Fp%3D18467" title="Open Secret: Gay &quot;Marriage&quot; Means No More Marriage">[8]</a>

Now that's liberal! Progressive even. Forget heterosexual marriage, forget marriage in general. Even forget monogamy why don't you. Mainstream liberalism just took another step toward the left.
