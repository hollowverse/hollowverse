Tiësto, real name Tijs Michiel Verwest, was born and raised in Breda, Netherlands.

The world-famous DJ appears to be completely non-religious, though a question and answer site reports that he once wore a T-shirt that read: "Love is my religion."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhat_is_the_religion_of_tiesto" title="What is the religion of tiesto?">[1]</a>

If he is non-religious, it would come as no surprise. His home country of The Netherlands is one of the most secular countries in the world, with only 39% of citizens having any sort of religious affiliation at all.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNetherlands%23Religion" title="Netherlands">[2]</a>

Other than that, in his song, "Beautiful Things," Tiësto said:

>God won't waste this simplicity on possibility.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fartists.letssingit.com%2Ftiesto-lyrics-beautiful-things-jhb17d7%23axzz2EdBvnj2G" title="Tiësto – Beautiful Things Lyrics">[3]</a>

But I'm not sure what that means.


## Liberal homeland

Politically, Tiësto is equally vague. He's done some charity events in support of victims of the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20081227151243%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiesto.com%2Fcontent%2Ftpl_news.asp%3Fnid%3D71%26step%3D10%26pid%3DNaN" title="Tiësto closes fundraiser in the Netherlands for Asian tsunami victims">[4]</a> and HIV/AIDS research and awareness.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fweb.archive.org%2Fweb%2F20110708224352%2Fhttp%3A%2F%2Fwww.dance4life.com%2Fen_4life_news_article%2F2160" title="Tiësto new ambassador of Dance4Life">[5]</a>

But, unless it's in Dutch, there's nothing I can find amounting to any kind of social or political philosophy from Tiësto. Maybe he's got one, and just doesn't think it's appropriate to talk about it, or maybe he doesn't care.

I can tell you this. His home country is more liberal than most of the world, with legal marijuana, prostitution and gay marriage to name a few.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FNetherlands%23Religion" title="Netherlands">[6]</a> So, unless he's a sociopolitical outcast in his own country, he's probably quite a bit more liberal than the average fellow.
