DJ Khaled was born and raised in New Orleans, Louisiana.

With Khaled's Palestinian roots, it should come as no surprise that he's Muslim. He frequently wears a large piece that is the Arabic symbol for Allah.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fpassionweiss.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2008%2F02%2F51mgpzcoqml_ss500_.jpg" title="51mgpzcoqml_ss500_.jpg.">[1]</a> And he's been known to tweet his thanks to Allah.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdjkhaled%2Fstatus%2F260125484929650688" title="djkhaled: ALLAH THANK U FOR EVERYTHING …">[2]</a> In a particularly thankful post he wrote,

>Thank u! Allah! Thank u For everything! We have to give thanks for life every second threw good and hard times ! We so blessed!<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fdjkhaled%2Fstatus%2F227269164727934976" title="djkhaled: Thank u! Allah! Thank u For …">[3]</a>

Being Muslim is clearly central to his identity. When asked how his culture affects his music, he said,

>I represent the Palestinian life–that is who I am.  I'm Arab and I'm Muslim.  I represent God.  I represent love, unity, and peace.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fthehiphopcosign.wordpress.com%2F2007%2F06%2F07%2Fdj-khaled-hes-taking-over%2F" title="D.J. Khaled: He&apos;s Taking Over!!">[4]</a>

That sums it up pretty well: a Muslim he is.


## Go VOTE (for Obama)

Being of Palestinian descent, it seems likely that he's got a view on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but I couldn't find anything. I did, however, find out who he voted for in the 2012 presidential election. He wrote about a million–okay, maybe not that many but a lot–of tweets about Obama leading up to the election. On election day he wrote,

>Go VOTE for @BarackObama<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Ftweetwood.com%2Fconversation%2Fdjkhaled%2FBarackObama" title="Twitter conversation between DJ Khaled and Barack Obama.">[5]</a>

His Obama tweets don't exactly get into policy matter specifically, and I couldn't find much detail there. But as far as the word "nigga" can be political, he was pulled into that debate. After receiving some criticism for using that word he said,

>What makes me mad, 'cause when I grew up, niggas was calling me sand nigga. Now, that's ignorant, because there's only one way to say it. You can't say, 'Yo what up my sand nigga?' . . . When I say 'What up my nigga,' . . . That's just me greeting you with love, but if somebody takes it another way, they dumb, man.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fthegrio.com%2F2011%2F09%2F23%2Fdj-khaled-under-fire-for-n-word-use%2F" title="DJ Khaled under fire for n-word use.">[6]</a>

So even though he doesn't have a whole lot to say about politics, I think we can safely call him a Democrat for now.
