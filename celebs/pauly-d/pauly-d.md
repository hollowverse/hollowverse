Pauly D, whose real name is Paul DelVecchio, was born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island.

Pauly D is a Catholic, an Italian-American Catholic. These particular traits, among various others, combine to make what some might call a "Guido." Hey, we didn't say it, Pauly D said it:

>I was born and raised a guido. It's just a lifestyle, it's being Italian, it's representing, family, friends, tanning, gel, everything.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jerseyshorequotes.com%2Fcast%2Fpauly-d_quotes.htm" title="Pauly D Quotes, DJ Pauly D Delveccio from MTV Jersey Shore, PaulyD">[1]</a>

And yes, being a Guido comes with a certain Catholic obligation. Pauly D admitted to being a Catholic during the first season of "Jersey Shore"<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbustedhalo.com%2Ffeatures%2Flife-at-%25E2%2580%259Cthe-jersey-shore%25E2%2580%259D" title="Life at &quot;The Jersey Shore.&quot;">[2]</a> and at least one fan called Catholicism the seventh character on the series.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fdailybleach.com%2Fwas-jersey-shore-cancelled-for-being-too-heterosexual-and-too-catholic%2F" title="Was &quot;Jersey Shore&quot; Cancelled for Being Too Heterosexual and Too Catholic?">[3]</a>

Pauly D shows it off with cross tattoos<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fgossipolicious.blogspot.com%2F2010%2F09%2Fpauly-d-keeps-it-klassy.html" title="Pauly D keeps it Klassy">[4]</a> and wearing crosses and rosaries<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbustedhalo.com%2Ffeatures%2Flife-at-%25E2%2580%259Cthe-jersey-shore%25E2%2580%259D" title="Life at &quot;The Jersey Shore.&quot;">[5]</a> and no doubt a Hail Mary escaped his lips every now and then during some of the more sticky situations in "The Jersey Shore."

Is he a good Catholic? A devout Catholic? Only God can judge, as they say. But I was informed by a couple of Catholic Hollowverse readers that sex before marriage is a big no-no in the Catholic religion–and anyone who's watched even two or three episodes of "The Jersey Shore" knows Pauly D isn't living up to that particular edict.


## Yeaaaaah politics!

Sadly, Pauly D's political affiliation and/or views either largely don't exist or he's rather quiet about them.

He was part of a [video](http://www.thewrap.com/media/column-post/lady-gaga-and-pauly-d-want-you-remember-911-video-30744), along with a few other celebrities, encouraging Americans to not forget the events of September 11, 2001, so you know Pauly D has his patriotic moments. And even though he grew up in Rhode Island, when Hurricane Sandy decimated the New Jersey shoreline, Pauly D stepped in with charity concerts and appeals for help from the rest of America.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fusatoday%2Farticle%2F1692277" title="Pauly D Remixes it up for charity.">[6]</a> He said, "We all need to help rebuild."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.democratandchronicle.com%2Fusatoday%2Farticle%2F1692277" title="Pauly D Remixes it up for charity.">[7]</a>

I don't even know where to begin speculating what Pauly D's political views might be. He's young, Italian-American, rich… what could that mean? He's OK with having gay fans–but just OK. He said:

>That's fine. We've got all kinds of fans. They range from guys, girls, old people, young people, all nationalities. That's great. The more fans, the better.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.okmagazine.com%2Ffeatured%2Fpauly-d-riffs-sex-tape-gay-issue-turning-30" title="Pauly D Riffs on Sex Tape, Gay Issue, Turning 30">[8]</a>

Sounds good, keep us updated in the comments.
