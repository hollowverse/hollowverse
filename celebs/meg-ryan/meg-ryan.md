Meg Ryan, whose real name is Margaret Hyra, was born and raised in Fairfield, Connecticut.

It appears as though Ryan was raised Catholic and may have even completed her confirmation,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.monstersandcritics.com%2Fpeople%2FMeg-Ryan%2Fbiography%2F" title="Meg Ryan Biography.">[1]</a> although I couldn't find a completely reliable source cited for that claim. If she was Catholic back then, she's not talking about it too much these days.

The only reliable information I could find about Ryan's spirituality was that it is based in Buddhism more than anything else. She is greatly influenced by Eckhart Tolle,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jennycooney.com%2Fmegryan.html" title="Interview with Meg Ryan.">[2]</a> an author of several books on spirituality that are influenced by several religions, but based in no one in particular. She said,

>I'm a seeker with a capital 'S.' Eckhart has a philosophy that feeds my other interests and is all about presence and expanding your life by embracing the entirety of 'right now.' It's a simple philosophy but it goes with a lot of other Hindu and Buddhist philosophy I study.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.jennycooney.com%2Fmegryan.html" title="Interview with Meg Ryan.">[3]</a>

I couldn't find much else on Ryan's spiritual path, except that it led her to a group of Buddhist monks to bless some traditional robes that she would later wrap around trees, making the trees sacred.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbs.org%2Fwnet%2Fnature%2Fepisodes%2Fthe-white-elephants-of-thailand-with-meg-ryan%2Fphoto-essay-northern-thailands-elephants%2F2471%2Fattachment%2F92%2F" title="Photo Essay: Northern Thailand&apos;s Elephants A Blessing from Monks.">[4]</a>

## Just a Nice Liberal

As her spiritual leanings might suggest, Meg Ryan's political philosophy is definitely liberal. She doesn't talk about politics all that much; she gets involved. She has donated over $9,000 to Democratic politicians including Al Franken, John Kerry, and Barack Obama.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Fcelebrity_political_donations%2FMeg_Ryan.php" title="Meg Ryan&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[5]</a>

She filmed a documentary in the PBS series Nature to draw attention to white elephants in Thailand, an endangered species.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pbs.org%2Fwnet%2Fnature%2Fepisodes%2Fthe-white-elephants-of-thailand-with-meg-ryan%2Fintroduction%2F2411%2F" title="White Elephants of Thailand with Meg Ryan – Introduction.">[6]</a> She boycotted an Israeli film festival to protest Israeli policies towards Palestinians.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thedailybeast.com%2Fnewsweek%2F2010%2F07%2F24%2Fdon-t-boycott-israel.html" title="Idea of Boycotting Israel Is Repellent.">[7]</a>

And she's shown her support for women's rights by donating to the Hollywood Women's Political Committee<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.newsmeat.com%2Fcelebrity_political_donations%2FMeg_Ryan.php" title="Meg Ryan&apos;s Federal Campaign Contribution Report.">[8]</a> and supporting the organization Equality Now<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.babyrazzi.com%2Ftag%2Fmeg-ryan-photos%2F" title="Meg Ryan Photos.">[9]</a> which advocates for the rights of women across the globe.

I didn't find any passionate quotes from her about specific issues or politicians, except for this one about former Republican Vice Presidential candidate Sarah Palin:

>I guess we have to root for her in that her son just went off to Iraq, that's gotta be really, really tough. But she doesn't represent my politics at all.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hecklerspray.com%2Fmeg-ryan-pink-some-other-woman-drone-about-sarah-palin%2F200816140.php" title="Now Meg Ryan Gets To Drone On About Sarah Palin Too.">[10]</a>

Okay, so that was one of the least passionate things I've ever heard a liberal say about Sarah Palin. But maybe she just doesn't want to hurt anyone's feelings.
