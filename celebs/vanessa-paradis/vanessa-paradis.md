Vanessa Paradis was born and raised in Saint-Maur-des-Fossés, France.

The world of internet question/answer sites seems to think Paradis is Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwiki.answers.com%2FQ%2FWhat_religion_is_Vanessa_Paradis" title="What religion is Vanessa Paradis.">[1]</a> Even though she doesn't talk about the religion, it's definitely possible considering she is notoriously private about her personal life.

But the only references to spirituality I could find from Paradis were about reincarnation, not Jesus or the Virgin Mary. When talking about how lucky she has been in her life, she said,

>I do sometimes strongly hope that in a past life, my most recent life before this, I was absolutely horrible, evil, hideous. Because otherwise – well, hell, to even things up next time around, I'm going to have to pay for this one, am I not?<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fculture%2F2010%2Fjun%2F27%2Fvanessa-paradis-heartbreaker-interview" title="Vanessa Paradis: &apos;I hope that in a past life I was hideous, horrible, evil…&apos;">[2]</a>

That doesn't mean she's a convert to any Eastern philosophies though. She admits that even though the concept is appealing, she's not totally sure she believes it.

>I can't quite bring myself to believe it exists, but the notion has always enchanted me. It's a far better idea than there being nothing more than living and dying. I'd like to come back to life as a dolphin.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Fhome%2Fmoslive%2Farticle-2135534%2FVanessa-Paradis-I-used-bag-head.html" title="Vanessa Paradis: &apos;I used to go out with a bag over my head.&apos;">[3]</a>

So while she appears to be interested in the spiritual, I don't quite have enough information to classify her beliefs quite yet. If I had to guess, I'd call her agnostic.


## A politician's wife: Oh the horror!

Her politics are even more of a mystery. She hasn't stated an opinion on any candidates or hot-button issues in France or the United States. She dated actor Johnny Depp for many years, and has two children with him. Depp has some liberal beliefs, so maybe we can call her liberal-by-association.

The only thing she has to say about former French president Nicolas Sarkozy is that it would be unfortunate to be his wife:

>[You can't] start dancing like you want, in case the strap on your dress slips. And a country falls. It would be a curse, falling in love with a man who is president.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fculture%2F2010%2Fjun%2F27%2Fvanessa-paradis-heartbreaker-interview" title="Vanessa Paradis: &apos;I hope in the past I was hideous, horrible, evil…&apos;">[4]</a>

So Paradis either isn't very concerned about politics, or she's very concerned about keeping her political life private. Maybe in her next life her curse will be to come back as a politician's wife.
