Chris Pine was born and raised in Los Angeles, California in a show business dynasty family.

Pine has Jewish ancestry on his mother's side. Her parents, named Yetta Saporsnikova and Louis Goldfarb, were Jewish immigrants from Russia.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fethnicelebs.com%2Fchris-pine" title="Chris Pine">[1]</a> But Pine doesn't seem to have addressed his Jew-ness. Combine that with his father's gentile roots and my guess is that he doesn't really consider it too important to his life and worldview.

In fact, Pine has admitted to being an agnostic, though he does have some spiritual leanings. He said:

>I believe in luck and fate and I believe in karma, that the energy you put out in the world comes back to meet you. So if you have positive good energy, hopefully good things will come to you from the universe… I definitely have a spiritual outlook… I am not a religious guy, I am probably agnostic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm1517976%2Fbio" title="Chris Pine (I) – Biography">[2]</a>

It would appear that some of Pine's spiritual orientation comes from modern spiritual writers. Specifically, he's cited Wayne Dyer's book, The Power of Intention, as a guiding force in his life:

>I don't usually read self-help books, but I read a great book by a guy called Wayne Dyer, "The Power of Intention," which I loved… The more you are positive and say, I want to have a good life, the more you build that reality for yourself, by creating the life that you want.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm1517976%2Fbio" title="Chris Pine (I) – Biography">[3]</a>

## Silence in Hollywood is a political position

Pine is a closed book when it comes to politics. He's a third-generation member of the Hollywood labor force. It seems likely that the political malaise of that place would have seeped in at some point. But, on the other hand, he never mentioned Obama during the 2012 election, so what could that mean?

Of course, we're stereotyping, conjecturing, speculating.

Without that, though, all we've got to go on are his comments about a New York City gay pride parade he found himself unwillingly a part of. Apparently, he was chased by a man wearing only a sock, who shouted "Captain Kirk!" as he pursued Pine.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ontopmag.com%2Farticle.aspx%3Fid%3D12256" title="Chris Pine Chased Down At New York City Gay Pride">[4]</a> But for him, it was just a funny and slightly harrowing experience. Not any kind of statement of support or condemnation.

So, not much there readers. If you know something we don't, please let us know.
