Alan Rickman was born and raised in London, England.

Rickman had an upbringing of mixed religious heritage. His mother was a Methodist of Welsh descent and his father was an Irish Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alan-rickman.com%2Farticles%2Fangel.html" title="Interview: Angel with Horns – The Guardian">[1]</a> Rickman's father died when he was eight years-old,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000614%2Fbio" title="Alan Rickman – Biography">[2]</a> so it's reasonable to assume that Methodism was more influential in his life than Catholicism.

However, Rickman–who doesn't really like to talk about his personal life<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.goerie.com%2Fapps%2Fpbcs.dll%2Farticle%3FAID%3D%2F20081215%2FENTERTAINMENT0702%2F312159963%2F-1%2FENTERTAINMENT07" title="Rickman never mixes acting with personal life">[3]</a> –hasn't gotten into his own, adult spiritual beliefs. Plus, he played God's messenger in the Catholic-inspired comedy, Dogma, and didn't seem to bat an eye at the controversy that swirled around it.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Farticles.chicagotribune.com%2F1999-11-07%2Fnews%2F9911070455_1_jason-mewes-and-smith-dogma-catholic-league" title="A Practicing Catholic On The Religious Storm Of &apos;Dogma.&apos;">[4]</a>

As far as I can tell, Rickman has only commented on his "religion" by likening his involvement with live theatre to his own, personal spiritual calling.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DB-ivjlSuO90" title="Alan Rickman: Theatre is my religion…">[5]</a> I don't have an interpretation for this–perhaps he's an atheist or perhaps it was just a metaphor for him to describe how much he loves theatre.


## Labour by association

Rickman is widely cited as a Labour supporter.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0000614%2Fbio" title="Alan Rickman – Biography">[6]</a> But passion for politics is something Rickman says has cooled in his life as he's grown older, seemingly because he's tired of rhetoric and politicians talking the talk:

>I find myself becoming less and less enamoured of public statement – I'd rather see it in action.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alan-rickman.com%2Farticles%2Fangel.html" title="Interview: Angel with Horns – The Guardian">[7]</a>

But his girlfriend of nearly 40 years, Rima Horton, is an economist and Labour politician.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rbkc.gov.uk%2Fcommittees%2FMembers%2Ftabid%2F62%2Fctl%2FViewCMIS_Person%2Fmid%2F384%2Fid%2F212%2FDefault.aspx" title="Rima Horton">[8]</a> I imagine it's a very politically-aware relationship.

Rickman has been known to get annoyed when politics gets in the way of his "religion." When a play he was directing about an activist protesting Israel's involvement in the Gaza Strip was cancelled for political sensitivity issues, Rickman didn't mince words:

>This is censorship born out of fear, and the New York Theatre Workshop, the Royal Court, New York audiences – all of us are the losers.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.guardian.co.uk%2Fworld%2F2006%2Ffeb%2F28%2Fusa.israel" title="Rickman slams &apos;censorship&apos; of play about US Gaza activist">[9]</a>

So, between that and Dogma, Rickman isn't afraid to get into controversy, and he exercises his rights. Good on him.
