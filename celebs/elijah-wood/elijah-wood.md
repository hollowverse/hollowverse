Elijah Wood was born and raised in Ceder Rapids, Iowa.

Wood was raised a Catholic.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nndb.com%2Fpeople%2F765%2F000022699%2F" title="Elijah Wood">[1]</a> But we get the feeling it wasn't an overwhelming, guilt-ridden Catholic upbringing like, say, the one Carlos Santana describes. He once said:

>I was raised Catholic. Well, not that my mother wanted to make a priest out of me or anything. You could call me a Catholic light.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Falways.ejwsites.net%2FHumoInterview.html" title="Elijah Wood">[2]</a>

There's rumor that Wood is quite devout as an adult, even reports that he prays every night.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fbridgetbatson.hubpages.com%2Fhub%2FCatholic-Celebrity-Awards" title="Catholic Celebrity Awards">[3]</a> But I was unable to confirm that and given the fact that there's very little about Catholicism–or any religion for that matter–from Wood himself, it's a safe bet that he's either not religious or he keeps it to himself.


## Elven politics

Woods is clearly a liberal–and not in the "I'm a Hollywood star doing what all of the other Hollywood stars are doing" sort of way. And he might even be a bit of a populist and slightly radical.

He's never endorsed Obama that I can see, but he did hop on Twitter to applaud the president for his stance on gay marriage, saying:

>Obama announces support for same-sex marriage. Well said, sir. Equality is the key word.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fwoodelijah%2Fstatus%2F200567913818767360" title="Woodelijah: Obama announces support for…">[4]</a>

Plus, he supports the legalization of marijuana. Even though he's not a pot smoker himself, Wood said:

>I think the whole notion that marijuana is illegal is past the point of ridiculousness.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.huffingtonpost.com%2F2011%2F08%2F23%2Felijah-wood-covers-high-t_n_934474.html" title="Elijah Wood Covers &quot;High Times&quot;; Talks Marijuana Support">[5]</a>

More telling is Wood's stance on government and his support for the Occupy Wall Street movement. He was a promoter for a coalition called the 99 Percent Spring which brought together a wide range of groups to train and educate tens of thousands of people to be more effective agitators. It wasn't much of a success, apparently, and most Occupiers didn't back the project.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thenation.com%2Fblog%2F167253%2Foccupy-wall-street-activists-respond-99-spring%23" title="Occupy Wall Street Activists Respond to the 99 Percent Spring">[6]</a>

Still, Woods showed his share of solidarity. Stating his stance on public protests and political statements in general, Woods said:

>I always think it is important to question even your government, especially your government actually.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mania.com%2Felijah-wood-return-ring_article_37226.html" title="Elijah Wood: Return of the RING">[7]</a>
