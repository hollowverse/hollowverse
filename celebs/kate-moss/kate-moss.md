Kate Moss was born and raised in London, England.

There's only sparse information on Moss's potential spiritual leanings, and most of it only very recent. In 2009, rumor had it that Moss had purchased a four-foot high statue of the Buddha and had started meditating.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.interfaith.org%2F2009%2F05%2F19%2Fkate-moss-meditates-with-buddha%2F" title="Kate Moss meditates with Buddha.">[1]</a> But I could find no quotes from Moss herself about a foray into Buddhism.

Two years later she was married in a "religious" Christian ceremony,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2010724%2FKate-Moss-wedding-Model-weds-Jamie-Hince-racist-hair-stylist-anti-Semitic-designer-Nazi-saluting-rocker.html" title="What did the vicar think? Kate Moss weds Jamie Hince in front of a &apos;racist hair stylist, anti-Semitic designer and Nazi-saluting rocker.&apos;">[2]</a> which doesn't indicate much more than at least a loose affiliation with the religion through either herself or her husband.

But then, she also did a pretty good job of pissing off plenty of Christians with her photo spread in the magazine W's "Fashion Bible" issue. The photo where Moss holds a crucifix between her legs prompted one group to claim that she hates Christians.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christianpost.com%2Fnews%2Fkate-moss-accused-of-hating-christians-on-blasphemous-w-magazine-cover-69233%2F" title="Kate Moss Accused of &apos;Hating Christians&apos; on Blasphemous W Magazine Cover.">[3]</a>

I'm going to go ahead and say that's probably not true–although she might hate those Christians after that comment. But I think it's probable that Moss isn't terribly dedicated to the religion, if she considers herself Christian at all. And as far as Buddhism, it's anyone's guess.


## The Politics of Heroin Chic

There's not much info on Moss's political beliefs either. She hasn't weighed in on any political parties or candidates, gay marriage, environmentalism, or anything much. But she is famously a huge component of the body-image discussion.

Moss was the face and body of the size-zero, emaciated "[heroin chic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heroin_chic)" look in the nineties. The rise of the super-skinny super model, embodied by Moss, has been the focus of much criticism from those who claimed it promoted drug use. Bill Clinton said about the look,

>[It] is not creative. It's destructive. It's not beautiful. It is ugly. And this is not about art. It's about life and death. And glorifying death is not good for any society.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fopioids.com%2Fheroin%2Fheroinchic.html" title="President Clinton on Heroin Chic.">[4]</a>

And after Moss said her now-famous mantra that "nothing tastes as good as skinny feels," groups working with eating disorders have gotten on the model's case for promoting an unhealthy lifestyle.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.foxnews.com%2Fentertainment%2F2009%2F11%2F19%2Fbody-image-experts-slam-kate-moss-super-skinny-mantra%2F" title="Body Image Experts Slam Kate Moss for Super Skinny Mantra.">[5]</a>

But whether she's a positive role model for young women across the globe or not, it looks like Moss is going to stick to the realm of fashion and photographs and leave the politics up to somebody else.
