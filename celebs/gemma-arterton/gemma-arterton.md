Gemma Arterton was born and raised in Gravesend, Kent, England.

Arterton is listed on several sites as belonging to the Church of England, or Anglican church.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.whosdatedwho.com%2Fsections%2Fcelebrities%2Freligion%2Fanglican-episcopalian_g" title="Celebrity Religion – Anglican Episcopalian (Celebrities): G.">[1]</a> While it's certainly possible that she was raised in that tradition, there's no indication that she still practices the religion.

Nowhere that I found does she talk about God, praying, or being blessed. And, although I couldn't confirm it for sure, it doesn't appear that her wedding ceremony was religious. It wasn't held in a church, anyway.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.popsugar.com%2FPics-Gemma-Artertons-Wedding-Stefano-Catelli-8701533%3Fslide%3D15" title="Pics: Gemma Arterton&apos;s Wedding to Stefano Catelli.">[2]</a>

So unless one of you readers has more information for us, I'm going to assume that she's non-religious for now.

Arterton, likewise, doesn't have much to say about politics. I couldn't find any party endorsements, or even any indications that she's interested in voting. She doesn't appear to lend herself to any global causes that could possibly be considered political either. Except perhaps feminism.

The actress discussed in one interview how doors haven't opened up for women in Hollywood as much as one might guess. She said so many scripts portray women as background figures or only as the man's helper:

>What I want to do is find characters who are the focus. . . sexy and real women, not perfect, not pin-ups.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fculture%2Ffilm%2Ffilm-news%2F8004318%2FGemma-Arterton-said-films-place-women-in-background.html" title="Gemma Arterton said films place women in &apos;background.&apos;">[3]</a>

That's all we know about Arterton so far. If you have any leads for us on either her religion or politics, let us know in the comments!
