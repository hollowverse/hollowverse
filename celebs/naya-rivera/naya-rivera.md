Naya Rivera was born and raised in Valencia, California.

Rivera is a devout Christian–though there is no indication as to what denomination exactly. But she's obviously serious enough about it to tattoo a large cross on her back.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0729369%2Fbio" title="Naya Rivera – Biography">[1]</a> She has mentioned the difficulties associated with fame and religious devotion:

>It's hard and sort of sad that you do feel like you need to tread lightly when you say, 'Yes, I do go to church and I read the Bible,' because once you do that people will be like, 'Why are her boobs out? Why is her midriff showing? Why is she playing a lesbian?' I don't want to deal with that stuff, and so I've never really discussed it. It's very personal.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.starpulse.com%2Fnews%2Findex.php%2F2012%2F04%2F06%2Fsexy_glee_star_naya_rivera_prefers_tv_" title="Sexy &apos;Glee&apos; Star Naya Rivera Prefers TV High School To The Real Thing: &apos;I Was Super Flat-Chested and Really Skinny.&apos;">[2]</a>

Well, this isn't a surprising revelation considering that, for example, videos have been released of Rivera pole dancing<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fglobal.christianpost.com%2Fnews%2Fnaya-rivera-pole-dancing-video-stirs-controversy-75276%2F" title="Naya Rivera Pole Dancing Video Stirs Controversy.">[3]</a> and she occasionally tweets mildly irreverent things like:

>Jesus Christ better be playing at the Hollywood bowl for all this highland traffic to be legit.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2FNayaRivera%2Fstatus%2F4935349446" title="NayaRivers: Jesus Christ better be playing…">[4]</a>

Given her religiosity, one would imagine that if Jesus were to play the Hollywood bowl, Rivera would know about it.


## Two-pronged politics

Rivera's politics have two main themes: 2012 presidential politics and homosexuality.

She plays a lesbian on the hit show, Glee, and as such, has become a bit of an icon in the gay community. She said:

>I get so many tweets a day from people thanking me and saying how the role has changed their lives, enabling them to come out.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.latina.com%2Fentertainment%2Fbuzz%2Fnaya-rivera-latina-magazine-cover-may-2012" title="Naya Riveral Latina Magazine Cover: May 2012 Issue, Glee Star Naya Rivera">[5]</a>

She's returned the gratitude in kind, co-hosting the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation Awards (GLAAD Awards) and even auctioning off a $5,000 kiss for the organization.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20581651%2C00.html" title="GLAAD Awards Kiss-Off">[6]</a> Plus, she says she frequents gay bars–just a little side-note there.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fname%2Fnm0729369%2Fbio" title="Naya Rivera – Biography">[7]</a>

In 2012, when the Republicans were battling for the presidential nomination, Rivera expressed extreme dissatisfaction with candidate Rick Santorum. She tweeted:

>And now a political tweet: Rick Santorum is the most disgusting person I've ever seen in my life. Who is this clown?!<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sheknows.com%2Fentertainment%2Farticles%2F950015%2Fglee-cast-gets-political-with-rick-santorum-tweets" title="Glee cast gets political with Rick Santorum tweets">[8]</a>

And:

>And why are Americans letting [Santorum] open his ignorant mouth? #embarrassing<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sheknows.com%2Fentertainment%2Farticles%2F950015%2Fglee-cast-gets-political-with-rick-santorum-tweets" title="Glee cast gets political with Rick Santorum tweets">[9]</a>

When Obama ultimately won the election, she celebrated at a post-election party, and in the [photos](http://www.wetpaint.com/glee/articles/glees-naya-rivera-reacts-to-obamas-presidential-victory-photo), she looks pretty happy.

So, liberal Democrat seems an appropriate title.
