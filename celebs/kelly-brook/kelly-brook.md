Kelly Brook was born and raised in Rochester, Kent, England.

There's no evidence that Brook has any religious affiliation–no church-going, no meditating, no praying. I suppose she did do a little Christmas striptease video for your holiday viewing pleasure,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DrGF6nr1V3tA" title="Kelly Brook&apos;s Striptease Christmas Gift for Love Magazine.">[1]</a> but I'll just go out on a limb and say I don't think that makes her a Christian.

Considering that those in the United Kingdom who do not consider themselves associated with a religion outnumber those who do,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FReligion_in_the_United_Kingdom%23Belief" title="Religion in the United Kingdom.">[2]</a> it seems reasonable to think that Brook is a part of the former group.

And as far as her political beliefs, Brook has equally little to say. She hasn't endorsed any parties or candidates, and seems to generally stay out of the debate.

But if we were going to guess how she votes, we'd have to guess on the liberal side of things for just one reason: her involvement with PETA (People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals). In 2011, she posed naked for in an advertisement with the ultra-liberal animal rights organization painted as a snake with the words, "Who's Skin Are You In? . . . Animals Belong in the Wild, Not In Your Wardrobe."<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Fsecure.peta.org%2Fsite%2FAdvocacy%3Fcmd%3Ddisplay%26page%3DUserAction%26id%3D3825" title="Kelly Brook Asks, &apos;Whose Skin Are You In?&apos;">[3]</a>

Funny how the only clues we have to either her religious or political beliefs revolve around her getting naked. Maybe another indication that she's not conservative–religiously or politically? If you know otherwise, or have any more information, please let us know in the comments!
