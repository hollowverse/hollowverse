Jennifer "Jennie" Garth was born in Urbana, Illinois. She grew up mostly in Arcola, Illinois, and then Tuscola, Illinois and Glendale, Arizona.

Garth's religious upbringing is a bit of a mystery, which probably means there wasn't much of one. There isn't even a hint about it on the internet gossip columns, despite their keen interest in Garth's later conversion–or more specifically un-conversion.

Way back in 2001, Garth converted to Catholicism prior to marrying her Catholic second husband.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farchive%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20586873%2C00.html" title="Jennie Garth Speaks Out &apos;i Didn&apos;t Want a Divorce.&apos;">[1]</a> But, after the couple's divorce in 2012, Garth decided to divorce herself from her former husband's religion as well. She still calls herself "spiritual" however, so maybe something stuck.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.people.com%2Fpeople%2Farchive%2Farticle%2F0%2C%2C20586873%2C00.html" title="Jennie Garth Speaks Out &apos;i Didn&apos;t Want a Divorce.&apos;">[2]</a>

More recently she was seen carrying a self-help book based in Buddhist principals,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.dailymail.co.uk%2Ftvshowbiz%2Farticle-2292945%2FJennie-Garth-turns-Buddhist-self-help-book--seen-new-rocker-boyfriend-weeks.html" title="Jennie Garth turns to Buddhist self help book.">[3]</a> so maybe that's the direction her spirituality is headed. We'll just have to wait and see. Keep us updated in the comments, won't you?


## Rock What Vote?

Garth doesn't seem to be all too interested in the political debate, but she's not entirely absent. She posted a picture of herself wearing a "Rock the Vote" t-shirt a month before the election in 2012,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fp%2FQ8rdv3hgLN%2F" title="Photo by jenniegarth.">[4]</a> so presumably she voted. And even though election day passed without a mention on her [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jenniegarth) feed, it's probably a good bet that she voted for Obama.

First of all, she signed on to the two biggest liberal celebrity causes of the day: gay marriage and gun control. She retweeted a follower's post hashtagged with "#legalizegaymarriage."<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjenniegarth" title="Jennie Garth (jenniegarth) on Twitter.">[5]</a> And she tweeted a link to a MoveOn.org petition urging lawmakers to enact gun control measures after the Newtown elementary school shooting in 2012.<a class="source-citation" href="#https%3A%2F%2Ftwitter.com%2Fjenniegarth%2Fstatus%2F279740807051882496" title="jenniegarth: We have to do something! Please …">[6]</a>

She also does some occasional work with PETA,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.peta.org%2Ftv%2Fvideos%2Fcelebrities-skins%2F86654677001.aspx" title="Jennie Garth&apos;s &apos;Save the Seals&apos; Photo Shoot.">[7]</a> which doesn't necessarily mean liberal, but is a fairly decent indicator. So despite not being one of the most vocal celebrities, in the end, she's solidly in the liberal camp with most of the rest of her Hollywood cronies.
