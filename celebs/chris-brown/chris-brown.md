summaries:
  religion: "Brown is a born-again Christian who started singing at his church choir, but now uses religion to justify his less-than honorable behavior."
  politicalViews: "Brown hasn't contributed much to the political discussion. He does seem to support Barack Obama, so we're calling him a Democrat."

Chris Brown was born and raised in Tappahannock, Virginia.

Brown is a born-again Christian who got his start as a singer in his church choir.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.biography.com%2Fpeople%2Fchris-brown-265946" title="Chris Brown Biography – Facts, Birthday, Life Story">[1]</a>

In his professional life, Brown's faith wasn't really a big deal–until he beat up Rihanna. At that point, he was a music industry pariah, a media demon, and a Christian example of how not to be. But Brown used it to his advantage. Not only did he blame Satan for his deplorable behavior,<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thesuperficial.com%2Fchris-brown-blames-satan-for-releasing-new-rihanna-abuse-photos-02-2011" title="Chris Brown Blames Satan For Releasing New Rihanna Abuse Photos">[2]</a> he said that God was going to get him through the challenging time when everyone hated him. He said:

>I am seeking the counselling of my pastor, my mother and other loved ones and I am committed, with God's help, to emerging a better person.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.christiantoday.com%2Farticle%2Fchris.brown.seeking.gods.help.after.rihanna.row%2F22599.htm" title="Chris Brown seeking &apos;God&apos;s help&apos; after Rihanna row">[3]</a>

He might have gotten this idea from his mother, who also released a statement saying the whole women-bashing thing was about God somehow:

>You see this whole thing isn't about Chris. It's about God. He wants to show all of you the goodness of him through Chris.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.patheos.com%2Fblogs%2Ffriendlyatheist%2F2009%2F08%2F28%2Fchris-browns-mother-its-about-god%2F" title="Chris Brown&apos;s Mother: &quot;It&apos;s About God.&quot;">[4]</a>

What does that even mean? Did God make him beat Rihanna? Because I thought it was Satan. I think these people just use God as a catch-all, fair-weather excuse for anything and everything.


## Politics

It's unlikely that any politician actually wants Chris Brown's endorsement but he seems to be a fan of Barack Obama and was spotted wearing a shirt that read: "Obama or Die."<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.justjared.com%2F2008%2F08%2F28%2Fchris-brown-obama-or-die%2F" title="Chris Brown: Obama Or Die!">[5]</a>

Other than that, Brown doesn't seem too politically aware, except for voicing concern over massacres in Syria on Twitter, where he said:

>Houla Massacre OMG!!!!! Not cool!<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fjilliancyork.com%2F2012%2F05%2F26%2Fthe-politics-of-attention-on-chris-brown-and-syria%2F" title="The Politics of Attention: On Chris Brown and Syria">[6]</a>

Well put. Just brilliant.

And his relations with the gay community are less than ideal. Brown was reportedly using gay slurs at a gym basketball game, calling people faggots and saying things he didn't like (such as a bad play) were gay.<a class="source-citation" href="#http%3A%2F%2Fwww.radaronline.com%2Fexclusives%2F2011%2F07%2Fgay-rights-group-slams-chris-browns-homophobic-rant" title="Gay Rights Group Slams Chris Brown&apos;s Homophobic Rant">[7]</a>

So, I guess we'll call him a Democrat, but no honest liberal would call anyone a faggot. In all reality, Brown probably doesn't care for much–religiously or politically–other than himself.
