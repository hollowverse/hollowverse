When using a Vercel monorepo, where the decision to run a build or not depends on whether the project folder within the monorepo has edits in the last commit, you some times run into the issue where the build will not run when you want it to run. See this issue for more details https://github.com/vercel/vercel/discussions/7960

Commit a new emoji to this file to trigger the build manually.
